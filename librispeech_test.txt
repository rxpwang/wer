CONCORD RETURNED TO ITS PLACE AMIDST THE TENTS
THE ENGLISH FORWARDED TO THE FRENCH BASKETS OF FLOWERS OF WHICH THEY HAD MADE A PLENTIFUL PROVISION TO GREET THE ARRIVAL OF THE YOUNG PRINCESS THE FRENCH IN RETURN INVITED THE ENGLISH TO A SUPPER WHICH WAS TO BE GIVEN THE NEXT DAY
CONGRATULATIONS WERE POURED IN UPON THE PRINCESS EVERYWHERE DURING HER JOURNEY
FROM THE RESPECT PAID HER ON ALL SIDES SHE SEEMED LIKE A QUEEN AND FROM THE ADORATION WITH WHICH SHE WAS TREATED BY TWO OR THREE SHE APPEARED AN OBJECT OF WORSHIP THE QUEEN MOTHER GAVE THE FRENCH THE MOST AFFECTIONATE RECEPTION FRANCE WAS HER NATIVE COUNTRY AND SHE HAD SUFFERED TOO MUCH UNHAPPINESS IN ENGLAND FOR ENGLAND TO HAVE MADE HER FORGET FRANCE
SHE TAUGHT HER DAUGHTER THEN BY HER OWN AFFECTION FOR IT THAT LOVE FOR A COUNTRY WHERE THEY HAD BOTH BEEN HOSPITABLY RECEIVED AND WHERE A BRILLIANT FUTURE OPENED BEFORE THEM
THE COUNT HAD THROWN HIMSELF BACK ON HIS SEAT LEANING HIS SHOULDERS AGAINST THE PARTITION OF THE TENT AND REMAINED THUS HIS FACE BURIED IN HIS HANDS WITH HEAVING CHEST AND RESTLESS LIMBS
THIS HAS INDEED BEEN A HARASSING DAY CONTINUED THE YOUNG MAN HIS EYES FIXED UPON HIS FRIEND
YOU WILL BE FRANK WITH ME I ALWAYS AM
CAN YOU IMAGINE WHY BUCKINGHAM HAS BEEN SO VIOLENT I SUSPECT
IT IS YOU WHO ARE MISTAKEN RAOUL I HAVE READ HIS DISTRESS IN HIS EYES IN HIS EVERY GESTURE AND ACTION THE WHOLE DAY
I CAN PERCEIVE LOVE CLEARLY ENOUGH
I AM CONVINCED OF WHAT I SAY SAID THE COUNT
IT IS ANNOYANCE THEN
IN THOSE VERY TERMS I EVEN ADDED MORE
BUT CONTINUED RAOUL NOT INTERRUPTED BY THIS MOVEMENT OF HIS FRIEND HEAVEN BE PRAISED THE FRENCH WHO ARE PRONOUNCED TO BE THOUGHTLESS AND INDISCREET RECKLESS EVEN ARE CAPABLE OF BRINGING A CALM AND SOUND JUDGMENT TO BEAR ON MATTERS OF SUCH HIGH IMPORTANCE
THUS IT IS THAT THE HONOR OF THREE IS SAVED OUR COUNTRY'S OUR MASTER'S AND OUR OWN
YES I NEED REPOSE MANY THINGS HAVE AGITATED ME TO DAY BOTH IN MIND AND BODY WHEN YOU RETURN TO MORROW I SHALL NO LONGER BE THE SAME MAN
BUT IN THIS FRIENDLY PRESSURE RAOUL COULD DETECT THE NERVOUS AGITATION OF A GREAT INTERNAL CONFLICT
THE NIGHT WAS CLEAR STARLIT AND SPLENDID THE TEMPEST HAD PASSED AWAY AND THE SWEET INFLUENCES OF THE EVENING HAD RESTORED LIFE PEACE AND SECURITY EVERYWHERE
UPON THE LARGE SQUARE IN FRONT OF THE HOTEL THE SHADOWS OF THE TENTS INTERSECTED BY THE GOLDEN MOONBEAMS FORMED AS IT WERE A HUGE MOSAIC OF JET AND YELLOW FLAGSTONES
BRAGELONNE WATCHED FOR SOME TIME THE CONDUCT OF THE TWO LOVERS LISTENED TO THE LOUD AND UNCIVIL SLUMBERS OF MANICAMP WHO SNORED AS IMPERIOUSLY AS THOUGH HE WAS WEARING HIS BLUE AND GOLD INSTEAD OF HIS VIOLET SUIT
GOLIATH MAKES ANOTHER DISCOVERY
THEY WERE CERTAINLY NO NEARER THE SOLUTION OF THEIR PROBLEM
THE POOR LITTLE THINGS CRIED CYNTHIA THINK OF THEM HAVING BEEN TURNED TO THE WALL ALL THESE YEARS
NOW WHAT WAS THE SENSE OF IT TWO INNOCENT BABIES LIKE THAT
BUT JOYCE HAD NOT BEEN LISTENING ALL AT ONCE SHE PUT DOWN HER CANDLE ON THE TABLE AND FACED HER COMPANION
THE TWIN BROTHER DID SOMETHING SHE DIDN'T LIKE AND SHE TURNED HIS PICTURE TO THE WALL
HERS HAPPENED TO BE IN THE SAME FRAME TOO BUT SHE EVIDENTLY DIDN'T CARE ABOUT THAT
NOW WHAT HAVE YOU TO SAY CYNTHIA SPRAGUE
I THOUGHT WE WERE STUMPED AGAIN WHEN I FIRST SAW THAT PICTURE BUT IT'S BEEN OF SOME USE AFTER ALL
DO YOU SUPPOSE THE MINIATURE WAS A COPY OF THE SAME THING
WHAT IN THE WORLD IS THAT QUERIED JOYCE
THEY WORRY ME TERRIBLY AND BESIDES I'D LIKE TO SEE WHAT THIS LOVELY FURNITURE LOOKS LIKE WITHOUT SUCH QUANTITIES OF DUST ALL OVER IT GOOD SCHEME CYN
WE'LL COME IN HERE THIS AFTERNOON WITH OLD CLOTHES ON AND HAVE A REGULAR HOUSE CLEANING
IT CAN'T HURT ANYTHING I'M SURE FOR WE WON'T DISTURB THINGS AT ALL
THIS THOUGHT HOWEVER DID NOT ENTER THE HEADS OF THE ENTHUSIASTIC PAIR
SMUGGLING THE HOUSE CLEANING PARAPHERNALIA INTO THE CELLAR WINDOW UNOBSERVED THAT AFTERNOON PROVED NO EASY TASK FOR CYNTHIA HAD ADDED A WHISK BROOM AND DUST PAN TO THE OUTFIT
THE LURE PROVED TOO MUCH FOR HIM AND HE CAME SPORTING AFTER IT AS FRISKILY AS A YOUNG KITTEN MUCH TO CYNTHIA'S DELIGHT WHEN SHE CAUGHT SIGHT OF HIM
OH LET HIM COME ALONG SHE URGED I DO LOVE TO SEE HIM ABOUT THAT OLD HOUSE
HE MAKES IT SORT OF COZIER
NOW LET'S DUST THE FURNITURE AND PICTURES
YET LITTLE AS IT WAS IT HAD ALREADY MADE A VAST DIFFERENCE IN THE ASPECT OF THE ROOM
SURFACE DUST AT LEAST HAD BEEN REMOVED AND THE FINE OLD FURNITURE GAVE A HINT OF ITS REAL ELEGANCE AND POLISH
THEN SHE SUDDENLY REMARKED
AND MY POCKET MONEY IS GETTING LOW AGAIN AND YOU HAVEN'T ANY LEFT AS USUAL
THEY SAY ILLUMINATION BY CANDLE LIGHT IS THE PRETTIEST IN THE WORLD
WHY IT'S GOLIATH AS USUAL THEY BOTH CRIED PEERING IN
ISN'T HE THE GREATEST FOR GETTING INTO ODD CORNERS
FORGETTING ALL THEIR WEARINESS THEY SEIZED THEIR CANDLES AND SCURRIED THROUGH THE HOUSE FINDING AN OCCASIONAL PAPER TUCKED AWAY IN SOME ODD CORNER
WELL I'M CONVINCED THAT THE BOARDED UP HOUSE MYSTERY HAPPENED NOT EARLIER THAN APRIL SIXTEENTH EIGHTEEN SIXTY ONE AND PROBABLY NOT MUCH LATER
NO WORDS WERE SPOKEN NO LANGUAGE WAS UTTERED SAVE THAT OF WAILING AND HISSING AND THAT SOMEHOW WAS INDISTINCT AS IF IT EXISTED IN FANCY AND NOT IN REALITY
I HEARD A NOISE BEHIND I TURNED AND SAW KAFFAR HIS BLACK EYES SHINING WHILE IN HIS HAND HE HELD A GLEAMING KNIFE HE LIFTED IT ABOVE HIS HEAD AS IF TO STRIKE BUT I HAD THE STRENGTH OF TEN MEN AND I HURLED HIM FROM ME
ONWARD SAID A DISTANT VOICE
NO SOUND BROKE THE STILLNESS OF THE NIGHT
THE STORY OF ITS EVIL INFLUENCE CAME BACK TO ME AND IN MY BEWILDERED CONDITION I WONDERED WHETHER THERE WAS NOT SOME TRUTH IN WHAT HAD BEEN SAID
WHAT WAS THAT
WHAT THEN A HUMAN HAND LARGE AND SHAPELY APPEARED DISTINCTLY ON THE SURFACE OF THE POND
NOTHING MORE NOT EVEN THE WRIST TO WHICH IT MIGHT BE ATTACHED
IT DID NOT BECKON OR INDEED MOVE AT ALL IT WAS AS STILL AS THE HAND OF DEATH
I AWOKE TO CONSCIOUSNESS FIGHTING AT FIRST IT SEEMED AS IF I WAS FIGHTING WITH A PHANTOM BUT GRADUALLY MY OPPONENT BECAME MORE REAL TO ME IT WAS KAFFAR
A SOUND OF VOICES A FLASH OF LIGHT
A FEELING OF FREEDOM AND I WAS AWAKE WHERE
SAID ANOTHER VOICE WHICH I RECOGNIZED AS VOLTAIRE'S KAFFAR
I HAD SCARCELY KNOWN WHAT I HAD BEEN SAYING OR DOING UP TO THIS TIME BUT AS HE SPOKE I LOOKED AT MY HAND
IN THE LIGHT OF THE MOON I SAW A KNIFE RED WITH BLOOD AND MY HAND TOO WAS ALSO DISCOLOURED
I DO NOT KNOW I AM DAZED BEWILDERED
BUT THAT IS KAFFAR'S KNIFE
I KNOW HE HAD IT THIS VERY EVENING
I REMEMBER SAYING HAVE WE BEEN TOGETHER
VOLTAIRE PICKED UP SOMETHING FROM THE GROUND AND LOOKED AT IT
I SAY YOU DO KNOW WHAT THIS MEANS AND YOU MUST TELL US
A TERRIBLE THOUGHT FLASHED INTO MY MIND
I HAD AGAIN BEEN ACTING UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF THIS MAN'S POWER
PERCHANCE TOO KAFFAR'S DEATH MIGHT SERVE HIM IN GOOD STEAD
MY TONGUE REFUSED TO ARTICULATE MY POWER OF SPEECH LEFT ME
MY POSITION WAS TOO TERRIBLE
MY OVERWROUGHT NERVES YIELDED AT LAST
FOR SOME TIME AFTER THAT I REMEMBERED NOTHING DISTINCTLY
NOTWITHSTANDING THE HIGH RESOLUTION OF HAWKEYE HE FULLY COMPREHENDED ALL THE DIFFICULTIES AND DANGER HE WAS ABOUT TO INCUR
IN HIS RETURN TO THE CAMP HIS ACUTE AND PRACTISED INTELLECTS WERE INTENTLY ENGAGED IN DEVISING MEANS TO COUNTERACT A WATCHFULNESS AND SUSPICION ON THE PART OF HIS ENEMIES THAT HE KNEW WERE IN NO DEGREE INFERIOR TO HIS OWN
IN OTHER WORDS WHILE HE HAD IMPLICIT FAITH IN THE ABILITY OF BALAAM'S ASS TO SPEAK HE WAS SOMEWHAT SKEPTICAL ON THE SUBJECT OF A BEAR'S SINGING AND YET HE HAD BEEN ASSURED OF THE LATTER ON THE TESTIMONY OF HIS OWN EXQUISITE ORGANS
THERE WAS SOMETHING IN HIS AIR AND MANNER THAT BETRAYED TO THE SCOUT THE UTTER CONFUSION OF THE STATE OF HIS MIND
THE INGENIOUS HAWKEYE WHO RECALLED THE HASTY MANNER IN WHICH THE OTHER HAD ABANDONED HIS POST AT THE BEDSIDE OF THE SICK WOMAN WAS NOT WITHOUT HIS SUSPICIONS CONCERNING THE SUBJECT OF SO MUCH SOLEMN DELIBERATION
THE BEAR SHOOK HIS SHAGGY SIDES AND THEN A WELL KNOWN VOICE REPLIED
CAN THESE THINGS BE RETURNED DAVID BREATHING MORE FREELY AS THE TRUTH BEGAN TO DAWN UPON HIM
COME COME RETURNED HAWKEYE UNCASING HIS HONEST COUNTENANCE THE BETTER TO ASSURE THE WAVERING CONFIDENCE OF HIS COMPANION YOU MAY SEE A SKIN WHICH IF IT BE NOT AS WHITE AS ONE OF THE GENTLE ONES HAS NO TINGE OF RED TO IT THAT THE WINDS OF THE HEAVEN AND THE SUN HAVE NOT BESTOWED NOW LET US TO BUSINESS
THE YOUNG MAN IS IN BONDAGE AND MUCH I FEAR HIS DEATH IS DECREED
I GREATLY MOURN THAT ONE SO WELL DISPOSED SHOULD DIE IN HIS IGNORANCE AND I HAVE SOUGHT A GOODLY HYMN CAN YOU LEAD ME TO HIM
THE TASK WILL NOT BE DIFFICULT RETURNED DAVID HESITATING THOUGH I GREATLY FEAR YOUR PRESENCE WOULD RATHER INCREASE THAN MITIGATE HIS UNHAPPY FORTUNES
THE LODGE IN WHICH UNCAS WAS CONFINED WAS IN THE VERY CENTER OF THE VILLAGE AND IN A SITUATION PERHAPS MORE DIFFICULT THAN ANY OTHER TO APPROACH OR LEAVE WITHOUT OBSERVATION
FOUR OR FIVE OF THE LATTER ONLY LINGERED ABOUT THE DOOR OF THE PRISON OF UNCAS WARY BUT CLOSE OBSERVERS OF THE MANNER OF THEIR CAPTIVE
DELIVERED IN A STRONG TONE OF ASSENT ANNOUNCED THE GRATIFICATION THE SAVAGE WOULD RECEIVE IN WITNESSING SUCH AN EXHIBITION OF WEAKNESS IN AN ENEMY SO LONG HATED AND SO MUCH FEARED
THEY DREW BACK A LITTLE FROM THE ENTRANCE AND MOTIONED TO THE SUPPOSED CONJURER TO ENTER
BUT THE BEAR INSTEAD OF OBEYING MAINTAINED THE SEAT IT HAD TAKEN AND GROWLED
THE CUNNING MAN IS AFRAID THAT HIS BREATH WILL BLOW UPON HIS BROTHERS AND TAKE AWAY THEIR COURAGE TOO CONTINUED DAVID IMPROVING THE HINT HE RECEIVED THEY MUST STAND FURTHER OFF
THEN AS IF SATISFIED OF THEIR SAFETY THE SCOUT LEFT HIS POSITION AND SLOWLY ENTERED THE PLACE
IT WAS SILENT AND GLOOMY BEING TENANTED SOLELY BY THE CAPTIVE AND LIGHTED BY THE DYING EMBERS OF A FIRE WHICH HAD BEEN USED FOR THE PURPOSED OF COOKERY
UNCAS OCCUPIED A DISTANT CORNER IN A RECLINING ATTITUDE BEING RIGIDLY BOUND BOTH HANDS AND FEET BY STRONG AND PAINFUL WITHES
THE SCOUT WHO HAD LEFT DAVID AT THE DOOR TO ASCERTAIN THEY WERE NOT OBSERVED THOUGHT IT PRUDENT TO PRESERVE HIS DISGUISE UNTIL ASSURED OF THEIR PRIVACY
WHAT SHALL WE DO WITH THE MINGOES AT THE DOOR THEY COUNT SIX AND THIS SINGER IS AS GOOD AS NOTHING
THE DELAWARES ARE CHILDREN OF THE TORTOISE AND THEY OUTSTRIP THE DEER
UNCAS WHO HAD ALREADY APPROACHED THE DOOR IN READINESS TO LEAD THE WAY NOW RECOILED AND PLACED HIMSELF ONCE MORE IN THE BOTTOM OF THE LODGE
BUT HAWKEYE WHO WAS TOO MUCH OCCUPIED WITH HIS OWN THOUGHTS TO NOTE THE MOVEMENT CONTINUED SPEAKING MORE TO HIMSELF THAN TO HIS COMPANION
SO UNCAS YOU HAD BETTER TAKE THE LEAD WHILE I WILL PUT ON THE SKIN AGAIN AND TRUST TO CUNNING FOR WANT OF SPEED
WELL WHAT CAN'T BE DONE BY MAIN COURAGE IN WAR MUST BE DONE BY CIRCUMVENTION
AS SOON AS THESE DISPOSITIONS WERE MADE THE SCOUT TURNED TO DAVID AND GAVE HIM HIS PARTING INSTRUCTIONS
MY PURSUITS ARE PEACEFUL AND MY TEMPER I HUMBLY TRUST IS GREATLY GIVEN TO MERCY AND LOVE RETURNED DAVID A LITTLE NETTLED AT SO DIRECT AN ATTACK ON HIS MANHOOD BUT THERE ARE NONE WHO CAN SAY THAT I HAVE EVER FORGOTTEN MY FAITH IN THE LORD EVEN IN THE GREATEST STRAITS
IF YOU ARE NOT THEN KNOCKED ON THE HEAD YOUR BEING A NON COMPOSSER WILL PROTECT YOU AND YOU'LL THEN HAVE A GOOD REASON TO EXPECT TO DIE IN YOUR BED
SO CHOOSE FOR YOURSELF TO MAKE A RUSH OR TARRY HERE
BRAVELY AND GENEROUSLY HAS HE BATTLED IN MY BEHALF AND THIS AND MORE WILL I DARE IN HIS SERVICE
KEEP SILENT AS LONG AS MAY BE AND IT WOULD BE WISE WHEN YOU DO SPEAK TO BREAK OUT SUDDENLY IN ONE OF YOUR SHOUTINGS WHICH WILL SERVE TO REMIND THE INDIANS THAT YOU ARE NOT ALTOGETHER AS RESPONSIBLE AS MEN SHOULD BE
IF HOWEVER THEY TAKE YOUR SCALP AS I TRUST AND BELIEVE THEY WILL NOT DEPEND ON IT UNCAS AND I WILL NOT FORGET THE DEED BUT REVENGE IT AS BECOMES TRUE WARRIORS AND TRUSTY FRIENDS
HOLD SAID DAVID PERCEIVING THAT WITH THIS ASSURANCE THEY WERE ABOUT TO LEAVE HIM I AM AN UNWORTHY AND HUMBLE FOLLOWER OF ONE WHO TAUGHT NOT THE DAMNABLE PRINCIPLE OF REVENGE
THEN HEAVING A HEAVY SIGH PROBABLY AMONG THE LAST HE EVER DREW IN PINING FOR A CONDITION HE HAD SO LONG ABANDONED HE ADDED IT IS WHAT I WOULD WISH TO PRACTISE MYSELF AS ONE WITHOUT A CROSS OF BLOOD THOUGH IT IS NOT ALWAYS EASY TO DEAL WITH AN INDIAN AS YOU WOULD WITH A FELLOW CHRISTIAN
GOD BLESS YOU FRIEND I DO BELIEVE YOUR SCENT IS NOT GREATLY WRONG WHEN THE MATTER IS DULY CONSIDERED AND KEEPING ETERNITY BEFORE THE EYES THOUGH MUCH DEPENDS ON THE NATURAL GIFTS AND THE FORCE OF TEMPTATION
THE DELAWARE DOG HE SAID LEANING FORWARD AND PEERING THROUGH THE DIM LIGHT TO CATCH THE EXPRESSION OF THE OTHER'S FEATURES IS HE AFRAID
WILL THE HURONS HEAR HIS GROANS
THE MOHICAN STARTED ON HIS FEET AND SHOOK HIS SHAGGY COVERING AS THOUGH THE ANIMAL HE COUNTERFEITED WAS ABOUT TO MAKE SOME DESPERATE EFFORT
HE HAD NO OCCASION TO DELAY FOR AT THE NEXT INSTANT A BURST OF CRIES FILLED THE OUTER AIR AND RAN ALONG THE WHOLE EXTENT OF THE VILLAGE
UNCAS CAST HIS SKIN AND STEPPED FORTH IN HIS OWN BEAUTIFUL PROPORTIONS
SINCE THE PERIOD OF OUR TALE THE ACTIVE SPIRIT OF THE COUNTRY HAS SURROUNDED IT WITH A BELT OF RICH AND THRIVING SETTLEMENTS THOUGH NONE BUT THE HUNTER OR THE SAVAGE IS EVER KNOWN EVEN NOW TO PENETRATE ITS WILD RECESSES
THE DEWS WERE SUFFERED TO EXHALE AND THE SUN HAD DISPERSED THE MISTS AND WAS SHEDDING A STRONG AND CLEAR LIGHT IN THE FOREST WHEN THE TRAVELERS RESUMED THEIR JOURNEY
AFTER PROCEEDING A FEW MILES THE PROGRESS OF HAWKEYE WHO LED THE ADVANCE BECAME MORE DELIBERATE AND WATCHFUL
HE OFTEN STOPPED TO EXAMINE THE TREES NOR DID HE CROSS A RIVULET WITHOUT ATTENTIVELY CONSIDERING THE QUANTITY THE VELOCITY AND THE COLOR OF ITS WATERS
DISTRUSTING HIS OWN JUDGMENT HIS APPEALS TO THE OPINION OF CHINGACHGOOK WERE FREQUENT AND EARNEST
YET HERE ARE WE WITHIN A SHORT RANGE OF THE SCAROONS AND NOT A SIGN OF A TRAIL HAVE WE CROSSED
LET US RETRACE OUR STEPS AND EXAMINE AS WE GO WITH KEENER EYES
CHINGACHGOOK HAD CAUGHT THE LOOK AND MOTIONING WITH HIS HAND HE BADE HIM SPEAK
THE EYES OF THE WHOLE PARTY FOLLOWED THE UNEXPECTED MOVEMENT AND READ THEIR SUCCESS IN THE AIR OF TRIUMPH THAT THE YOUTH ASSUMED
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE WONDERFUL HAD HE SPOKEN WITHOUT A BIDDING
SEE SAID UNCAS POINTING NORTH AND SOUTH AT THE EVIDENT MARKS OF THE BROAD TRAIL ON EITHER SIDE OF HIM THE DARK HAIR HAS GONE TOWARD THE FOREST
IF A ROCK OR A RIVULET OR A BIT OF EARTH HARDER THAN COMMON SEVERED THE LINKS OF THE CLEW THEY FOLLOWED THE TRUE EYE OF THE SCOUT RECOVERED THEM AT A DISTANCE AND SELDOM RENDERED THE DELAY OF A SINGLE MOMENT NECESSARY
EXTINGUISHED BRANDS WERE LYING AROUND A SPRING THE OFFALS OF A DEER WERE SCATTERED ABOUT THE PLACE AND THE TREES BORE EVIDENT MARKS OF HAVING BEEN BROWSED BY THE HORSES
A CIRCLE OF A FEW HUNDRED FEET IN CIRCUMFERENCE WAS DRAWN AND EACH OF THE PARTY TOOK A SEGMENT FOR HIS PORTION
THE EXAMINATION HOWEVER RESULTED IN NO DISCOVERY
THE WHOLE PARTY CROWDED TO THE SPOT WHERE UNCAS POINTED OUT THE IMPRESSION OF A MOCCASIN IN THE MOIST ALLUVION
RUN BACK UNCAS AND BRING ME THE SIZE OF THE SINGER'S FOOT
ELEVEN O'CLOCK HAD STRUCK IT WAS A FINE CLEAR NIGHT THEY WERE THE ONLY PERSONS ON THE ROAD AND THEY SAUNTERED LEISURELY ALONG TO AVOID PAYING THE PRICE OF FATIGUE FOR THE RECREATION PROVIDED FOR THE TOLEDANS IN THEIR VALLEY OR ON THE BANKS OF THEIR RIVER
SECURE AS HE THOUGHT IN THE CAREFUL ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE IN THAT CITY AND THE CHARACTER OF ITS WELL DISPOSED INHABITANTS THE GOOD HIDALGO WAS FAR FROM THINKING THAT ANY DISASTER COULD BEFAL HIS FAMILY
RODOLFO AND HIS COMPANIONS WITH THEIR FACES MUFFLED IN THEIR CLOAKS STARED RUDELY AND INSOLENTLY AT THE MOTHER THE DAUGHTER AND THE SERVANT MAID
IN A MOMENT HE COMMUNICATED HIS THOUGHTS TO HIS COMPANIONS AND IN THE NEXT MOMENT THEY RESOLVED TO TURN BACK AND CARRY HER OFF TO PLEASE RODOLFO FOR THE RICH WHO ARE OPEN HANDED ALWAYS FIND PARASITES READY TO ENCOURAGE THEIR BAD PROPENSITIES AND THUS TO CONCEIVE THIS WICKED DESIGN TO COMMUNICATE IT APPROVE IT RESOLVE ON RAVISHING LEOCADIA AND TO CARRY THAT DESIGN INTO EFFECT WAS THE WORK OF A MOMENT
THEY DREW THEIR SWORDS HID THEIR FACES IN THE FLAPS OF THEIR CLOAKS TURNED BACK AND SOON CAME IN FRONT OF THE LITTLE PARTY WHO HAD NOT YET DONE GIVING THANKS TO GOD FOR THEIR ESCAPE FROM THOSE AUDACIOUS MEN
FINALLY THE ONE PARTY WENT OFF EXULTING AND THE OTHER WAS LEFT IN DESOLATION AND WOE
RODOLFO ARRIVED AT HIS OWN HOUSE WITHOUT ANY IMPEDIMENT AND LEOCADIA'S PARENTS REACHED THEIRS HEART BROKEN AND DESPAIRING
MEANWHILE RODOLFO HAD LEOCADIA SAFE IN HIS CUSTODY AND IN HIS OWN APARTMENT
WHO TOUCHES ME AM I IN BED
MOTHER DEAR FATHER DO YOU HEAR ME
IT IS THE ONLY AMENDS I ASK OF YOU FOR THE WRONG YOU HAVE DONE ME
SHE FOUND THE DOOR BUT IT WAS LOCKED OUTSIDE
SHE SUCCEEDED IN OPENING THE WINDOW AND THE MOONLIGHT SHONE IN SO BRIGHTLY THAT SHE COULD DISTINGUISH THE COLOUR OF SOME DAMASK HANGINGS IN THE ROOM
SHE SAW THAT THE BED WAS GILDED AND SO RICH THAT IT SEEMED THAT OF A PRINCE RATHER THAN OF A PRIVATE GENTLEMAN
AMONG OTHER THINGS ON WHICH SHE CAST HER EYES WAS A SMALL CRUCIFIX OF SOLID SILVER STANDING ON A CABINET NEAR THE WINDOW
THIS PERSON WAS RODOLFO WHO THOUGH HE HAD GONE TO LOOK FOR HIS FRIENDS HAD CHANGED HIS MIND IN THAT RESPECT NOT THINKING IT ADVISABLE TO ACQUAINT THEM WITH WHAT HAD PASSED BETWEEN HIM AND THE GIRL
ON THE CONTRARY HE RESOLVED TO TELL THEM THAT REPENTING OF HIS VIOLENCE AND MOVED BY HER TEARS HE HAD ONLY CARRIED HER HALF WAY TOWARDS HIS HOUSE AND THEN LET HER GO
CHOKING WITH EMOTION LEOCADI MADE A SIGN TO HER PARENTS THAT SHE WISHED TO BE ALONE WITH THEM
THAT WOULD BE VERY WELL MY CHILD REPLIED HER FATHER IF YOUR PLAN WERE NOT LIABLE TO BE FRUSTRATED BY ORDINARY CUNNING BUT NO DOUBT THIS IMAGE HAS BEEN ALREADY MISSED BY ITS OWNER AND HE WILL HAVE SET IT DOWN FOR CERTAIN THAT IT WAS TAKEN OUT OF THE ROOM BY THE PERSON HE LOCKED UP THERE
WHAT YOU HAD BEST DO MY CHILD IS TO KEEP IT AND PRAY TO IT THAT SINCE IT WAS A WITNESS TO YOUR UNDOING IT WILL DEIGN TO VINDICATE YOUR CAUSE BY ITS RIGHTEOUS JUDGMENT
THUS DID THIS HUMANE AND RIGHT MINDED FATHER COMFORT HIS UNHAPPY DAUGHTER AND HER MOTHER EMBRACING HER AGAIN DID ALL SHE COULD TO SOOTHE HER FEELINGS
SHE MEANWHILE PASSED HER LIFE WITH HER PARENTS IN THE STRICTEST RETIREMENT NEVER LETTING HERSELF BE SEEN BUT SHUNNING EVERY EYE LEST IT SHOULD READ HER MISFORTUNE IN HER FACE
TIME ROLLED ON THE HOUR OF HER DELIVERY ARRIVED IT TOOK PLACE IN THE UTMOST SECRECY HER MOTHER TAKING UPON HER THE OFFICE OF MIDWIFE AND SHE GAVE BIRTH TO A SON ONE OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL EVER SEEN
WHEN THE BOY WALKED THROUGH THE STREETS BLESSINGS WERE SHOWERED UPON HIM BY ALL WHO SAW HIM BLESSINGS UPON HIS BEAUTY UPON THE MOTHER THAT BORE HIM UPON THE FATHER THAT BEGOT HIM UPON THOSE WHO BROUGHT HIM UP SO WELL
ONE DAY WHEN THE BOY WAS SENT BY HIS GRANDFATHER WITH A MESSAGE TO A RELATION HE PASSED ALONG A STREET IN WHICH THERE WAS A GREAT CONCOURSE OF HORSEMEN
THE BED SHE TOO WELL REMEMBERED WAS THERE AND ABOVE ALL THE CABINET ON WHICH HAD STOOD THE IMAGE SHE HAD TAKEN AWAY WAS STILL ON THE SAME SPOT
LUIS WAS OUT OF DANGER IN A FORTNIGHT IN A MONTH HE ROSE FROM HIS BED AND DURING ALL THAT TIME HE WAS VISITED DAILY BY HIS MOTHER AND GRANDMOTHER AND TREATED BY THE MASTER AND MISTRESS OF THE HOUSE AS IF HE WAS THEIR OWN CHILD
THUS SAYING AND PRESSING THE CRUCIFIX TO HER BREAST SHE FELL FAINTING INTO THE ARMS OF DONA ESTAFANIA WHO AS A GENTLEWOMAN TO WHOSE SEX PITY IS AS NATURAL AS CRUELTY IS TO MAN INSTANTLY PRESSED HER LIPS TO THOSE OF THE FAINTING GIRL SHEDDING OVER HER SO MANY TEARS THAT THERE NEEDED NO OTHER SPRINKLING OF WATER TO RECOVER LEOCADIA FROM HER SWOON
I HAVE GREAT THINGS TO TELL YOU SENOR SAID DONA ESTAFANIA TO HER HUSBAND THE CREAM AND SUBSTANCE OF WHICH IS THIS THE FAINTING GIRL BEFORE YOU IS YOUR DAUGHTER AND THAT BOY IS YOUR GRANDSON
THIS TRUTH WHICH I HAVE LEARNED FROM HER LIPS IS CONFIRMED BY HIS FACE IN WHICH WE HAVE BOTH BEHELD THAT OF OUR SON
JUST THEN LEOCADIA CAME TO HERSELF AND EMBRACING THE CROSS SEEMED CHANGED INTO A SEA OF TEARS AND THE GENTLEMAN REMAINED IN UTTER BEWILDERMENT UNTIL HIS WIFE HAD REPEATED TO HIM FROM BEGINNING TO END LEOCADIA'S WHOLE STORY AND HE BELIEVED IT THROUGH THE BLESSED DISPENSATION OF HEAVEN WHICH HAD CONFIRMED IT BY SO MANY CONVINCING TESTIMONIES
SO PERSUASIVE WERE HER ENTREATIES AND SO STRONG HER ASSURANCES THAT NO HARM WHATEVER COULD RESULT TO THEM FROM THE INFORMATION SHE SOUGHT THEY WERE INDUCED TO CONFESS THAT ONE SUMMER'S NIGHT THE SAME SHE HAD MENTIONED THEMSELVES AND ANOTHER FRIEND BEING OUT ON A STROLL WITH RODOLFO THEY HAD BEEN CONCERNED IN THE ABDUCTION OF A GIRL WHOM RODOLFO CARRIED OFF WHILST THE REST OF THEM DETAINED HER FAMILY WHO MADE A GREAT OUTCRY AND WOULD HAVE DEFENDED HER IF THEY COULD
FOR GOD'S SAKE MY LADY MOTHER GIVE ME A WIFE WHO WOULD BE AN AGREEABLE COMPANION NOT ONE WHO WILL DISGUST ME SO THAT WE MAY BOTH BEAR EVENLY AND WITH MUTUAL GOOD WILL THE YOKE IMPOSED ON US BY HEAVEN INSTEAD OF PULLING THIS WAY AND THAT WAY AND FRETTING EACH OTHER TO DEATH
HER BEARING WAS GRACEFUL AND ANIMATED SHE LED HER SON BY THE HAND AND BEFORE HER WALKED TWO MAIDS WITH WAX LIGHTS AND SILVER CANDLESTICKS
ALL ROSE TO DO HER REVERENCE AS IF SOMETHING FROM HEAVEN HAD MIRACULOUSLY APPEARED BEFORE THEM BUT GAZING ON HER ENTRANCED WITH ADMIRATION NOT ONE OF THEM WAS ABLE TO ADDRESS A SINGLE WORD TO HER
SHE REFLECTED HOW NEAR SHE STOOD TO THE CRISIS WHICH WAS TO DETERMINE WHETHER SHE WAS TO BE BLESSED OR UNHAPPY FOR EVER AND RACKED BY THE INTENSITY OF HER EMOTIONS SHE SUDDENLY CHANGED COLOUR HER HEAD DROPPED AND SHE FELL FORWARD IN A SWOON INTO THE ARMS OF THE DISMAYED ESTAFANIA
HIS MOTHER HAD LEFT HER TO HIM AS BEING HER DESTINED PROTECTOR BUT WHEN SHE SAW THAT HE TOO WAS INSENSIBLE SHE WAS NEAR MAKING A THIRD AND WOULD HAVE DONE SO HAD HE NOT COME TO HIMSELF
KNOW THEN SON OF MY HEART THAT THIS FAINTING LADY IS YOUR REAL BRIDE I SAY REAL BECAUSE SHE IS THE ONE WHOM YOUR FATHER AND I HAVE CHOSEN FOR YOU AND THE PORTRAIT WAS A PRETENCE
JUST AT THE MOMENT WHEN THE TEARS OF THE PITYING BEHOLDERS FLOWED FASTEST AND THEIR EJACULATIONS WERE MOST EXPRESSIVE OF DESPAIR LEOCADIA GAVE SIGNS OF RECOVERY AND BROUGHT BACK GLADNESS TO THE HEARTS OF ALL
WHEN SHE CAME TO HER SENSES AND BLUSHING TO FIND HERSELF IN RODOLFO'S ARMS WOULD HAVE DISENGAGED HERSELF NO SENORA HE SAID THAT MUST NOT BE STRIVE NOT TO WITHDRAW FROM THE ARMS OF HIM WHO HOLDS YOU IN HIS SOUL
THIS WAS DONE FOR THE EVENT TOOK PLACE AT A TIME WHEN THE CONSENT OF THE PARTIES WAS SUFFICIENT FOR THE CELEBRATION OF A MARRIAGE WITHOUT ANY OF THE PRELIMINARY FORMALITIES WHICH ARE NOW SO PROPERLY REQUIRED
NOR WAS RODOLFO LESS SURPRISED THAN THEY AND THE BETTER TO ASSURE HIMSELF OF SO WONDERFUL A FACT HE BEGGED LEOCADIA TO GIVE HIM SOME TOKEN WHICH SHOULD MAKE PERFECTLY CLEAR TO HIM THAT WHICH INDEED HE DID NOT DOUBT SINCE IT WAS AUTHENTICATED BY HIS PARENTS
AND HOW ODD THE DIRECTIONS WILL LOOK
POOR ALICE
IT WAS THE WHITE RABBIT RETURNING SPLENDIDLY DRESSED WITH A PAIR OF WHITE KID GLOVES IN ONE HAND AND A LARGE FAN IN THE OTHER HE CAME TROTTING ALONG IN A GREAT HURRY MUTTERING TO HIMSELF AS HE CAME OH THE DUCHESS THE DUCHESS
OH WON'T SHE BE SAVAGE IF I'VE KEPT HER WAITING
ALICE TOOK UP THE FAN AND GLOVES AND AS THE HALL WAS VERY HOT SHE KEPT FANNING HERSELF ALL THE TIME SHE WENT ON TALKING DEAR DEAR HOW QUEER EVERYTHING IS TO DAY
AND YESTERDAY THINGS WENT ON JUST AS USUAL
I WONDER IF I'VE BEEN CHANGED IN THE NIGHT
I ALMOST THINK I CAN REMEMBER FEELING A LITTLE DIFFERENT
I'LL TRY IF I KNOW ALL THE THINGS I USED TO KNOW
I SHALL NEVER GET TO TWENTY AT THAT RATE
HOW CHEERFULLY HE SEEMS TO GRIN HOW NEATLY SPREAD HIS CLAWS AND WELCOME LITTLE FISHES IN WITH GENTLY SMILING JAWS
NO I'VE MADE UP MY MIND ABOUT IT IF I'M MABEL I'LL STAY DOWN HERE
IT'LL BE NO USE THEIR PUTTING THEIR HEADS DOWN AND SAYING COME UP AGAIN DEAR
I AM SO VERY TIRED OF BEING ALL ALONE HERE
AND I DECLARE IT'S TOO BAD THAT IT IS
I WISH I HADN'T CRIED SO MUCH SAID ALICE AS SHE SWAM ABOUT TRYING TO FIND HER WAY OUT
I SHALL BE PUNISHED FOR IT NOW I SUPPOSE BY BEING DROWNED IN MY OWN TEARS
THAT WILL BE A QUEER THING TO BE SURE
I AM VERY TIRED OF SWIMMING ABOUT HERE O MOUSE
CRIED ALICE AGAIN FOR THIS TIME THE MOUSE WAS BRISTLING ALL OVER AND SHE FELT CERTAIN IT MUST BE REALLY OFFENDED
WE WON'T TALK ABOUT HER ANY MORE IF YOU'D RATHER NOT WE INDEED
SATURDAY AUGUST FIFTEENTH THE SEA UNBROKEN ALL ROUND NO LAND IN SIGHT
THE HORIZON SEEMS EXTREMELY DISTANT
ALL MY DANGER AND SUFFERINGS WERE NEEDED TO STRIKE A SPARK OF HUMAN FEELING OUT OF HIM BUT NOW THAT I AM WELL HIS NATURE HAS RESUMED ITS SWAY
YOU SEEM ANXIOUS MY UNCLE I SAID SEEING HIM CONTINUALLY WITH HIS GLASS TO HIS EYE ANXIOUS
ONE MIGHT BE WITH LESS REASON THAN NOW
I AM NOT COMPLAINING THAT THE RATE IS SLOW BUT THAT THE SEA IS SO WIDE
WE ARE LOSING TIME AND THE FACT IS I HAVE NOT COME ALL THIS WAY TO TAKE A LITTLE SAIL UPON A POND ON A RAFT
HE CALLED THIS SEA A POND AND OUR LONG VOYAGE TAKING A LITTLE SAIL
THEREFORE DON'T TALK TO ME ABOUT VIEWS AND PROSPECTS
I TAKE THIS AS MY ANSWER AND I LEAVE THE PROFESSOR TO BITE HIS LIPS WITH IMPATIENCE
SUNDAY AUGUST SIXTEENTH
NOTHING NEW WEATHER UNCHANGED THE WIND FRESHENS
BUT THERE SEEMED NO REASON TO FEAR
THE SHADOW OF THE RAFT WAS CLEARLY OUTLINED UPON THE SURFACE OF THE WAVES
TRULY THIS SEA IS OF INFINITE WIDTH
IT MUST BE AS WIDE AS THE MEDITERRANEAN OR THE ATLANTIC AND WHY NOT
THESE THOUGHTS AGITATED ME ALL DAY AND MY IMAGINATION SCARCELY CALMED DOWN AFTER SEVERAL HOURS SLEEP
I SHUDDER AS I RECALL THESE MONSTERS TO MY REMEMBRANCE
I SAW AT THE HAMBURG MUSEUM THE SKELETON OF ONE OF THESE CREATURES THIRTY FEET IN LENGTH
I SUPPOSE PROFESSOR LIEDENBROCK WAS OF MY OPINION TOO AND EVEN SHARED MY FEARS FOR AFTER HAVING EXAMINED THE PICK HIS EYES TRAVERSED THE OCEAN FROM SIDE TO SIDE
TUESDAY AUGUST EIGHTEENTH
DURING HIS WATCH I SLEPT
TWO HOURS AFTERWARDS A TERRIBLE SHOCK AWOKE ME
THE RAFT WAS HEAVED UP ON A WATERY MOUNTAIN AND PITCHED DOWN AGAIN AT A DISTANCE OF TWENTY FATHOMS
THERE'S A WHALE A WHALE CRIED THE PROFESSOR
FLIGHT WAS OUT OF THE QUESTION NOW THE REPTILES ROSE THEY WHEELED AROUND OUR LITTLE RAFT WITH A RAPIDITY GREATER THAN THAT OF EXPRESS TRAINS
TWO MONSTERS ONLY WERE CREATING ALL THIS COMMOTION AND BEFORE MY EYES ARE TWO REPTILES OF THE PRIMITIVE WORLD
I CAN DISTINGUISH THE EYE OF THE ICHTHYOSAURUS GLOWING LIKE A RED HOT COAL AND AS LARGE AS A MAN'S HEAD
ITS JAW IS ENORMOUS AND ACCORDING TO NATURALISTS IT IS ARMED WITH NO LESS THAN ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY TWO TEETH
THOSE HUGE CREATURES ATTACKED EACH OTHER WITH THE GREATEST ANIMOSITY
SUDDENLY THE ICHTHYOSAURUS AND THE PLESIOSAURUS DISAPPEAR BELOW LEAVING A WHIRLPOOL EDDYING IN THE WATER
AS FOR THE ICHTHYOSAURUS HAS HE RETURNED TO HIS SUBMARINE CAVERN
THE ROARINGS BECOME LOST IN THE DISTANCE
THE WEATHER IF WE MAY USE THAT TERM WILL CHANGE BEFORE LONG
THE ATMOSPHERE IS CHARGED WITH VAPOURS PERVADED WITH THE ELECTRICITY GENERATED BY THE EVAPORATION OF SALINE WATERS
THE ELECTRIC LIGHT CAN SCARCELY PENETRATE THROUGH THE DENSE CURTAIN WHICH HAS DROPPED OVER THE THEATRE ON WHICH THE BATTLE OF THE ELEMENTS IS ABOUT TO BE WAGED
THE AIR IS HEAVY THE SEA IS CALM
FROM TIME TO TIME A FLEECY TUFT OF MIST WITH YET SOME GLEAMING LIGHT LEFT UPON IT DROPS DOWN UPON THE DENSE FLOOR OF GREY AND LOSES ITSELF IN THE OPAQUE AND IMPENETRABLE MASS
THE ATMOSPHERE IS EVIDENTLY CHARGED AND SURCHARGED WITH ELECTRICITY
THE WIND NEVER LULLS BUT TO ACQUIRE INCREASED STRENGTH THE VAST BANK OF HEAVY CLOUDS IS A HUGE RESERVOIR OF FEARFUL WINDY GUSTS AND RUSHING STORMS
THERE'S A HEAVY STORM COMING ON I CRIED POINTING TOWARDS THE HORIZON
THOSE CLOUDS SEEM AS IF THEY WERE GOING TO CRUSH THE SEA
ON THE MAST ALREADY I SEE THE LIGHT PLAY OF A LAMBENT SAINT ELMO'S FIRE THE OUTSTRETCHED SAIL CATCHES NOT A BREATH OF WIND AND HANGS LIKE A SHEET OF LEAD
BUT IF WE HAVE NOW CEASED TO ADVANCE WHY DO WE YET LEAVE THAT SAIL LOOSE WHICH AT THE FIRST SHOCK OF THE TEMPEST MAY CAPSIZE US IN A MOMENT
THAT WILL BE SAFEST NO NO NEVER
THE PILED UP VAPOURS CONDENSE INTO WATER AND THE AIR PUT INTO VIOLENT ACTION TO SUPPLY THE VACUUM LEFT BY THE CONDENSATION OF THE MISTS ROUSES ITSELF INTO A WHIRLWIND
HANS STIRS NOT
FROM THE UNDER SURFACE OF THE CLOUDS THERE ARE CONTINUAL EMISSIONS OF LURID LIGHT ELECTRIC MATTER IS IN CONTINUAL EVOLUTION FROM THEIR COMPONENT MOLECULES THE GASEOUS ELEMENTS OF THE AIR NEED TO BE SLAKED WITH MOISTURE FOR INNUMERABLE COLUMNS OF WATER RUSH UPWARDS INTO THE AIR AND FALL BACK AGAIN IN WHITE FOAM
I REFER TO THE THERMOMETER IT INDICATES THE FIGURE IS OBLITERATED
IS THE ATMOSPHERIC CONDITION HAVING ONCE REACHED THIS DENSITY TO BECOME FINAL
THE RAFT BEARS ON STILL TO THE SOUTH EAST
AT NOON THE VIOLENCE OF THE STORM REDOUBLES
EACH OF US IS LASHED TO SOME PART OF THE RAFT
THE WAVES RISE ABOVE OUR HEADS
THEY SEEM TO BE WE ARE LOST BUT I AM NOT SURE
HE NODS HIS CONSENT
THE FIREBALL HALF OF IT WHITE HALF AZURE BLUE AND THE SIZE OF A TEN INCH SHELL MOVED SLOWLY ABOUT THE RAFT BUT REVOLVING ON ITS OWN AXIS WITH ASTONISHING VELOCITY AS IF WHIPPED ROUND BY THE FORCE OF THE WHIRLWIND
HERE IT COMES THERE IT GLIDES NOW IT IS UP THE RAGGED STUMP OF THE MAST THENCE IT LIGHTLY LEAPS ON THE PROVISION BAG DESCENDS WITH A LIGHT BOUND AND JUST SKIMS THE POWDER MAGAZINE HORRIBLE
WE SHALL BE BLOWN UP BUT NO THE DAZZLING DISK OF MYSTERIOUS LIGHT NIMBLY LEAPS ASIDE IT APPROACHES HANS WHO FIXES HIS BLUE EYE UPON IT STEADILY IT THREATENS THE HEAD OF MY UNCLE WHO FALLS UPON HIS KNEES WITH HIS HEAD DOWN TO AVOID IT
A SUFFOCATING SMELL OF NITROGEN FILLS THE AIR IT ENTERS THE THROAT IT FILLS THE LUNGS
WE SUFFER STIFLING PAINS
THE BOGUS LEGISLATURE NUMBERED THIRTY SIX MEMBERS
THIS WAS AT THE MARCH ELECTION EIGHTEEN FIFTY FIVE
THAT SUMMER'S EMIGRATION HOWEVER BEING MAINLY FROM THE FREE STATES GREATLY CHANGED THE RELATIVE STRENGTH OF THE TWO PARTIES
FOR GENERAL SERVICE THEREFORE REQUIRING NO SPECIAL EFFORT THE NUMERICAL STRENGTH OF THE FACTIONS WAS ABOUT EQUAL WHILE ON EXTRAORDINARY OCCASIONS THE TWO THOUSAND BORDER RUFFIAN RESERVE LYING A LITTLE FARTHER BACK FROM THE STATE LINE COULD AT ANY TIME EASILY TURN THE SCALE
THE FREE STATE MEN HAD ONLY THEIR CONVICTIONS THEIR INTELLIGENCE THEIR COURAGE AND THE MORAL SUPPORT OF THE NORTH THE CONSPIRACY HAD ITS SECRET COMBINATION THE TERRITORIAL OFFICIALS THE LEGISLATURE THE BOGUS LAWS THE COURTS THE MILITIA OFFICERS THE PRESIDENT AND THE ARMY
THIS WAS A FORMIDABLE ARRAY OF ADVANTAGES SLAVERY WAS PLAYING WITH LOADED DICE
COMING BY WAY OF THE MISSOURI RIVER TOWNS HE FELL FIRST AMONG BORDER RUFFIAN COMPANIONSHIP AND INFLUENCES AND PERHAPS HAVING HIS INCLINATIONS ALREADY MOLDED BY HIS WASHINGTON INSTRUCTIONS HIS EARLY IMPRESSIONS WERE DECIDEDLY ADVERSE TO THE FREE STATE CAUSE
HIS RECEPTION SPEECH AT WESTPORT IN WHICH HE MAINTAINED THE LEGALITY OF THE LEGISLATURE AND HIS DETERMINATION TO ENFORCE THEIR LAWS DELIGHTED HIS PRO SLAVERY AUDITORS
ALL THE TERRITORIAL DIGNITARIES WERE PRESENT GOVERNOR SHANNON PRESIDED JOHN CALHOUN THE SURVEYOR GENERAL MADE THE PRINCIPAL SPEECH A DENUNCIATION OF THE ABOLITIONISTS SUPPORTING THE TOPEKA MOVEMENT CHIEF JUSTICE LECOMPTE DIGNIFIED THE OCCASION WITH APPROVING REMARKS
ALL DISSENT ALL NON COMPLIANCE ALL HESITATION ALL MERE SILENCE EVEN WERE IN THEIR STRONGHOLD TOWNS LIKE LEAVENWORTH BRANDED AS ABOLITIONISM DECLARED TO BE HOSTILITY TO THE PUBLIC WELFARE AND PUNISHED WITH PROSCRIPTION PERSONAL VIOLENCE EXPULSION AND FREQUENTLY DEATH
OF THE LYNCHINGS THE MOBS AND THE MURDERS IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE EXCEPT IN A VERY EXTENDED WORK TO NOTE THE FREQUENT AND ATROCIOUS DETAILS
THE PRESENT CHAPTERS CAN ONLY TOUCH UPON THE MORE SALIENT MOVEMENTS OF THE CIVIL WAR IN KANSAS WHICH HAPPILY WERE NOT SANGUINARY IF HOWEVER THE INDIVIDUAL AND MORE ISOLATED CASES OF BLOODSHED COULD BE DESCRIBED THEY WOULD SHOW A STARTLING AGGREGATE OF BARBARITY AND LOSS OF LIFE FOR OPINION'S SAKE
SEVERAL HUNDRED FREE STATE MEN PROMPTLY RESPONDED TO THE SUMMONS
IT WAS IN FACT THE BEST WEAPON OF ITS DAY
THE LEADERS OF THE CONSPIRACY BECAME DISTRUSTFUL OF THEIR POWER TO CRUSH THE TOWN
ONE OF HIS MILITIA GENERALS SUGGESTED THAT THE GOVERNOR SHOULD REQUIRE THE OUTLAWS AT LAWRENCE AND ELSEWHERE TO SURRENDER THE SHARPS RIFLES ANOTHER WROTE ASKING HIM TO CALL OUT THE GOVERNMENT TROOPS AT FORT LEAVENWORTH
THE GOVERNOR ON HIS PART BECOMING DOUBTFUL OF THE LEGALITY OF EMPLOYING MISSOURI MILITIA TO ENFORCE KANSAS LAWS WAS ALSO EAGER TO SECURE THE HELP OF FEDERAL TROOPS
SHERIFF JONES HAD HIS POCKETS ALWAYS FULL OF WRITS ISSUED IN THE SPIRIT OF PERSECUTION BUT WAS OFTEN BAFFLED BY THE SHARP WITS AND READY RESOURCES OF THE FREE STATE PEOPLE AND SOMETIMES DEFIED OUTRIGHT
LITTLE BY LITTLE HOWEVER THE LATTER BECAME HEMMED AND BOUND IN THE MESHES OF THE VARIOUS DEVICES AND PROCEEDINGS WHICH THE TERRITORIAL OFFICIALS EVOLVED FROM THE BOGUS LAWS
TO EMBARRASS THIS DAMAGING EXPOSURE JUDGE LECOMPTE ISSUED A WRIT AGAINST THE EX GOVERNOR ON A FRIVOLOUS CHARGE OF CONTEMPT
THE INCIDENT WAS NOT VIOLENT NOR EVEN DRAMATIC NO POSSE WAS SUMMONED NO FURTHER EFFORT MADE AND REEDER FEARING PERSONAL VIOLENCE SOON FLED IN DISGUISE
BUT THE AFFAIR WAS MAGNIFIED AS A CROWNING PROOF THAT THE FREE STATE MEN WERE INSURRECTIONISTS AND OUTLAWS
FROM THESE AGAIN SPRANG BARRICADED AND FORTIFIED DWELLINGS CAMPS AND SCOUTING PARTIES FINALLY CULMINATING IN ROVING GUERRILLA BANDS HALF PARTISAN HALF PREDATORY
THEIR DISTINCTIVE CHARACTERS HOWEVER DISPLAY ONE BROAD AND UNFAILING DIFFERENCE
THE FREE STATE MEN CLUNG TO THEIR PRAIRIE TOWNS AND PRAIRIE RAVINES WITH ALL THE OBSTINACY AND COURAGE OF TRUE DEFENDERS OF THEIR HOMES AND FIRESIDES
THEIR ASSUMED CHARACTER CHANGED WITH THEIR CHANGING OPPORTUNITIES OR NECESSITIES
IN THE SHOOTING OF SHERIFF JONES IN LAWRENCE AND IN THE REFUSAL OF EX GOVERNOR BEEDER TO ALLOW THE DEPUTY MARSHAL TO ARREST HIM THEY DISCOVERED GRAVE OFFENSES AGAINST THE TERRITORIAL AND UNITED STATES LAWS
FOOTNOTE SUMNER TO SHANNON MAY TWELFTH EIGHTEEN FIFTY SIX
PRIVATE PERSONS WHO HAD LEASED THE FREE STATE HOTEL VAINLY BESOUGHT THE VARIOUS AUTHORITIES TO PREVENT THE DESTRUCTION OF THEIR PROPERTY
TEN DAYS WERE CONSUMED IN THESE NEGOTIATIONS BUT THE SPIRIT OF VENGEANCE REFUSED TO YIELD
HE SUMMONED HALF A DOZEN CITIZENS TO JOIN HIS POSSE WHO FOLLOWED OBEYED AND ASSISTED HIM
HE CONTINUED HIS PRETENDED SEARCH AND TO GIVE COLOR TO HIS ERRAND MADE TWO ARRESTS
THE FREE STATE HOTEL A STONE BUILDING IN DIMENSIONS FIFTY BY SEVENTY FEET THREE STORIES HIGH AND HANDSOMELY FURNISHED PREVIOUSLY OCCUPIED ONLY FOR LODGING ROOMS ON THAT DAY FOR THE FIRST TIME OPENED ITS TABLE ACCOMMODATIONS TO THE PUBLIC AND PROVIDED A FREE DINNER IN HONOR OF THE OCCASION
AS HE HAD PROMISED TO PROTECT THE HOTEL THE REASSURED CITIZENS BEGAN TO LAUGH AT THEIR OWN FEARS
TO THEIR SORROW THEY WERE SOON UNDECEIVED
THE MILITARY FORCE PARTLY RABBLE PARTLY ORGANIZED HAD MEANWHILE MOVED INTO THE TOWN
HE PLANTED A COMPANY BEFORE THE HOTEL AND DEMANDED A SURRENDER OF THE ARMS BELONGING TO THE FREE STATE MILITARY COMPANIES
HALF AN HOUR LATER TURNING A DEAF EAR TO ALL REMONSTRANCE HE GAVE THE PROPRIETORS UNTIL FIVE O'CLOCK TO REMOVE THEIR FAMILIES AND PERSONAL PROPERTY FROM THE FREE STATE HOTEL
ATCHISON WHO HAD BEEN HARANGUING THE MOB PLANTED HIS TWO GUNS BEFORE THE BUILDING AND TRAINED THEM UPON IT
THE INMATES BEING REMOVED AT THE APPOINTED HOUR A FEW CANNON BALLS WERE FIRED THROUGH THE STONE WALLS
IN THIS INCIDENT CONTRASTING THE CREATIVE AND THE DESTRUCTIVE SPIRIT OF THE FACTIONS THE EMIGRANT AID SOCIETY OF MASSACHUSETTS FINDS ITS MOST HONORABLE AND TRIUMPHANT VINDICATION
THE WHOLE PROCEEDING WAS SO CHILDISH THE MISERABLE PLOT SO TRANSPARENT THE OUTRAGE SO GROSS AS TO BRING DISGUST TO THE BETTER CLASS OF BORDER RUFFIANS WHO WERE WITNESSES AND ACCESSORIES
RELOCATED FOOTNOTE GOVERNOR ROBINSON BEING ON HIS WAY EAST THE STEAMBOAT ON WHICH HE WAS TRAVELING STOPPED AT LEXINGTON MISSOURI
IN A FEW DAYS AN OFFICER CAME WITH A REQUISITION FROM GOVERNOR SHANNON AND TOOK THE PRISONER BY LAND TO WESTPORT AND AFTERWARDS FROM THERE TO KANSAS CITY AND LEAVENWORTH
HERE HE WAS PLACED IN THE CUSTODY OF CAPTAIN MARTIN OF THE KICKAPOO RANGERS WHO PROVED A KIND JAILER AND MATERIALLY ASSISTED IN PROTECTING HIM FROM THE DANGEROUS INTENTIONS OF THE MOB WHICH AT THAT TIME HELD LEAVENWORTH UNDER A REIGN OF TERROR
CAPTAIN MARTIN SAID I SHALL GIVE YOU A PISTOL TO HELP PROTECT YOURSELF IF WORSE COMES TO WORST
IN THE EARLY MORNING OF THE NEXT DAY MAY TWENTY NINTH A COMPANY OF DRAGOONS WITH ONE EMPTY SADDLE CAME DOWN FROM THE FORT AND WHILE THE PRO SLAVERY MEN STILL SLEPT THE PRISONER AND HIS ESCORT WERE ON THEIR WAY ACROSS THE PRAIRIES TO LECOMPTON IN THE CHARGE OF OFFICERS OF THE UNITED STATES ARMY
IT IS A VERY FINE OLD PLACE OF RED BRICK SOFTENED BY A PALE POWDERY LICHEN WHICH HAS DISPERSED ITSELF WITH HAPPY IRREGULARITY SO AS TO BRING THE RED BRICK INTO TERMS OF FRIENDLY COMPANIONSHIP WITH THE LIMESTONE ORNAMENTS SURROUNDING THE THREE GABLES THE WINDOWS AND THE DOOR PLACE
BUT THE WINDOWS ARE PATCHED WITH WOODEN PANES AND THE DOOR I THINK IS LIKE THE GATE IT IS NEVER OPENED
FOR IT IS A SOLID HEAVY HANDSOME DOOR AND MUST ONCE HAVE BEEN IN THE HABIT OF SHUTTING WITH A SONOROUS BANG BEHIND A LIVERIED LACKEY WHO HAD JUST SEEN HIS MASTER AND MISTRESS OFF THE GROUNDS IN A CARRIAGE AND PAIR
A LARGE OPEN FIREPLACE WITH RUSTY DOGS IN IT AND A BARE BOARDED FLOOR AT THE FAR END FLEECES OF WOOL STACKED UP IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FLOOR SOME EMPTY CORN BAGS
AND WHAT THROUGH THE LEFT HAND WINDOW
SEVERAL CLOTHES HORSES A PILLION A SPINNING WHEEL AND AN OLD BOX WIDE OPEN AND STUFFED FULL OF COLOURED RAGS
AT THE EDGE OF THIS BOX THERE LIES A GREAT WOODEN DOLL WHICH SO FAR AS MUTILATION IS CONCERNED BEARS A STRONG RESEMBLANCE TO THE FINEST GREEK SCULPTURE AND ESPECIALLY IN THE TOTAL LOSS OF ITS NOSE
THE HISTORY OF THE HOUSE IS PLAIN NOW
BUT THERE IS ALWAYS A STRONGER SENSE OF LIFE WHEN THE SUN IS BRILLIANT AFTER RAIN AND NOW HE IS POURING DOWN HIS BEAMS AND MAKING SPARKLES AMONG THE WET STRAW AND LIGHTING UP EVERY PATCH OF VIVID GREEN MOSS ON THE RED TILES OF THE COW SHED AND TURNING EVEN THE MUDDY WATER THAT IS HURRYING ALONG THE CHANNEL TO THE DRAIN INTO A MIRROR FOR THE YELLOW BILLED DUCKS WHO ARE SEIZING THE OPPORTUNITY OF GETTING A DRINK WITH AS MUCH BODY IN IT AS POSSIBLE
FOR THE GREAT BARN DOORS ARE THROWN WIDE OPEN AND MEN ARE BUSY THERE MENDING THE HARNESS UNDER THE SUPERINTENDENCE OF MISTER GOBY THE WHITTAW OTHERWISE SADDLER WHO ENTERTAINS THEM WITH THE LATEST TREDDLESTON GOSSIP
HETTY SORREL OFTEN TOOK THE OPPORTUNITY WHEN HER AUNT'S BACK WAS TURNED OF LOOKING AT THE PLEASING REFLECTION OF HERSELF IN THOSE POLISHED SURFACES FOR THE OAK TABLE WAS USUALLY TURNED UP LIKE A SCREEN AND WAS MORE FOR ORNAMENT THAN FOR USE AND SHE COULD SEE HERSELF SOMETIMES IN THE GREAT ROUND PEWTER DISHES THAT WERE RANGED ON THE SHELVES ABOVE THE LONG DEAL DINNER TABLE OR IN THE HOBS OF THE GRATE WHICH ALWAYS SHONE LIKE JASPER
DO NOT SUPPOSE HOWEVER THAT MISSUS POYSER WAS ELDERLY OR SHREWISH IN HER APPEARANCE SHE WAS A GOOD LOOKING WOMAN NOT MORE THAN EIGHT AND THIRTY OF FAIR COMPLEXION AND SANDY HAIR WELL SHAPEN LIGHT FOOTED
THE FAMILY LIKENESS BETWEEN HER AND HER NIECE DINAH MORRIS WITH THE CONTRAST BETWEEN HER KEENNESS AND DINAH'S SERAPHIC GENTLENESS OF EXPRESSION MIGHT HAVE SERVED A PAINTER AS AN EXCELLENT SUGGESTION FOR A MARTHA AND MARY
HER TONGUE WAS NOT LESS KEEN THAN HER EYE AND WHENEVER A DAMSEL CAME WITHIN EARSHOT SEEMED TO TAKE UP AN UNFINISHED LECTURE AS A BARREL ORGAN TAKES UP A TUNE PRECISELY AT THE POINT WHERE IT HAD LEFT OFF
THE FACT THAT IT WAS CHURNING DAY WAS ANOTHER REASON WHY IT WAS INCONVENIENT TO HAVE THE WHITTAWS AND WHY CONSEQUENTLY MISSUS POYSER SHOULD SCOLD MOLLY THE HOUSEMAID WITH UNUSUAL SEVERITY
TO ALL APPEARANCE MOLLY HAD GOT THROUGH HER AFTER DINNER WORK IN AN EXEMPLARY MANNER HAD CLEANED HERSELF WITH GREAT DISPATCH AND NOW CAME TO ASK SUBMISSIVELY IF SHE SHOULD SIT DOWN TO HER SPINNING TILL MILKING TIME
SPINNING INDEED
I NEVER KNEW YOUR EQUALS FOR GALLOWSNESS
WHO TAUGHT YOU TO SCRUB A FLOOR I SHOULD LIKE TO KNOW
COMB THE WOOL FOR THE WHITTAWS INDEED
THAT'S WHAT YOU'D LIKE TO BE DOING IS IT
THAT'S THE WAY WITH YOU THAT'S THE ROAD YOU'D ALL LIKE TO GO HEADLONGS TO RUIN
MISTER OTTLEY'S INDEED
YOU'RE A RARE UN FOR SITTING DOWN TO YOUR WORK A LITTLE WHILE AFTER IT'S TIME TO PUT BY
MUNNY MY IRON'S TWITE TOLD PEASE PUT IT DOWN TO WARM
COLD IS IT MY DARLING BLESS YOUR SWEET FACE
SHE'S GOING TO PUT THE IRONING THINGS AWAY
MUNNY I TOULD IKE TO DO INTO DE BARN TO TOMMY TO SEE DE WHITTAWD
NO NO NO TOTTY UD GET HER FEET WET SAID MISSUS POYSER CARRYING AWAY HER IRON
DID EVER ANYBODY SEE THE LIKE SCREAMED MISSUS POYSER RUNNING TOWARDS THE TABLE WHEN HER EYE HAD FALLEN ON THE BLUE STREAM
TOTTY HOWEVER HAD DESCENDED FROM HER CHAIR WITH GREAT SWIFTNESS AND WAS ALREADY IN RETREAT TOWARDS THE DAIRY WITH A SORT OF WADDLING RUN AND AN AMOUNT OF FAT ON THE NAPE OF HER NECK WHICH MADE HER LOOK LIKE THE METAMORPHOSIS OF A WHITE SUCKLING PIG
AND SHE WAS VERY FOND OF YOU TOO AUNT RACHEL
I OFTEN HEARD HER TALK OF YOU IN THE SAME SORT OF WAY
WHEN SHE HAD THAT BAD ILLNESS AND I WAS ONLY ELEVEN YEARS OLD SHE USED TO SAY YOU'LL HAVE A FRIEND ON EARTH IN YOUR AUNT RACHEL IF I'M TAKEN FROM YOU FOR SHE HAS A KIND HEART AND I'M SURE I'VE FOUND IT SO
AND THERE'S LINEN IN THE HOUSE AS I COULD WELL SPARE YOU FOR I'VE GOT LOTS O SHEETING AND TABLE CLOTHING AND TOWELLING AS ISN'T MADE UP
BUT NOT MORE THAN WHAT'S IN THE BIBLE AUNT SAID DINAH
NAY DEAR AUNT YOU NEVER HEARD ME SAY THAT ALL PEOPLE ARE CALLED TO FORSAKE THEIR WORK AND THEIR FAMILIES
WE CAN ALL BE SERVANTS OF GOD WHEREVER OUR LOT IS CAST BUT HE GIVES US DIFFERENT SORTS OF WORK ACCORDING AS HE FITS US FOR IT AND CALLS US TO IT
I CAN NO MORE HELP SPENDING MY LIFE IN TRYING TO DO WHAT I CAN FOR THE SOULS OF OTHERS THAN YOU COULD HELP RUNNING IF YOU HEARD LITTLE TOTTY CRYING AT THE OTHER END OF THE HOUSE THE VOICE WOULD GO TO YOUR HEART YOU WOULD THINK THE DEAR CHILD WAS IN TROUBLE OR IN DANGER AND YOU COULDN'T REST WITHOUT RUNNING TO HELP HER AND COMFORT HER
I'VE STRONG ASSURANCE THAT NO EVIL WILL HAPPEN TO YOU AND MY UNCLE AND THE CHILDREN FROM ANYTHING I'VE DONE
I DIDN'T PREACH WITHOUT DIRECTION
DIRECTION
I HANNA COMMON PATIENCE WITH YOU
BY THIS TIME THE TWO GENTLEMEN HAD REACHED THE PALINGS AND HAD GOT DOWN FROM THEIR HORSES IT WAS PLAIN THEY MEANT TO COME IN
SAID MISTER IRWINE WITH HIS STATELY CORDIALITY
OH SIR DON'T MENTION IT SAID MISSUS POYSER
I DELIGHT IN YOUR KITCHEN
POYSER IS NOT AT HOME IS HE
SAID CAPTAIN DONNITHORNE SEATING HIMSELF WHERE HE COULD SEE ALONG THE SHORT PASSAGE TO THE OPEN DAIRY DOOR
NO SIR HE ISN'T HE'S GONE TO ROSSETER TO SEE MISTER WEST THE FACTOR ABOUT THE WOOL
BUT THERE'S FATHER THE BARN SIR IF HE'D BE OF ANY USE
NO THANK YOU I'LL JUST LOOK AT THE WHELPS AND LEAVE A MESSAGE ABOUT THEM WITH YOUR SHEPHERD
I MUST COME ANOTHER DAY AND SEE YOUR HUSBAND I WANT TO HAVE A CONSULTATION WITH HIM ABOUT HORSES
FOR IF HE'S ANYWHERE ON THE FARM WE CAN SEND FOR HIM IN A MINUTE
OH SIR SAID MISSUS POYSER RATHER ALARMED YOU WOULDN'T LIKE IT AT ALL
BUT YOU KNOW MORE ABOUT THAT THAN I DO SIR
I THINK I SHOULD BE DOING YOU A SERVICE TO TURN YOU OUT OF SUCH A PLACE
I KNOW HIS FARM IS IN BETTER ORDER THAN ANY OTHER WITHIN TEN MILES OF US AND AS FOR THE KITCHEN HE ADDED SMILING I DON'T BELIEVE THERE'S ONE IN THE KINGDOM TO BEAT IT
BY THE BY I'VE NEVER SEEN YOUR DAIRY I MUST SEE YOUR DAIRY MISSUS POYSER
THIS MISSUS POYSER SAID BLUSHING AND BELIEVING THAT THE CAPTAIN WAS REALLY INTERESTED IN HER MILK PANS AND WOULD ADJUST HIS OPINION OF HER TO THE APPEARANCE OF HER DAIRY
OH I'VE NO DOUBT IT'S IN CAPITAL ORDER
AND OFTEN HAS MY MOTHER SAID WHILE ON HER LAP I LAID MY HEAD SHE FEARED FOR TIME I WAS NOT MADE BUT FOR ETERNITY
WHY ARE WE TO BE DENIED EACH OTHER'S SOCIETY
WHY ARE WE TO BE DIVIDED
SURELY IT MUST BE BECAUSE WE ARE IN DANGER OF LOVING EACH OTHER TOO WELL OF LOSING SIGHT OF THE CREATOR IN IDOLATRY OF THE CREATURE
WE USED TO DISPUTE ABOUT POLITICS AND RELIGION
SHE A TORY AND CLERGYMAN'S DAUGHTER WAS ALWAYS IN A MINORITY OF ONE IN OUR HOUSE OF VIOLENT DISSENT AND RADICALISM
HER FEEBLE HEALTH GAVE HER HER YIELDING MANNER FOR SHE COULD NEVER OPPOSE ANY ONE WITHOUT GATHERING UP ALL HER STRENGTH FOR THE STRUGGLE
HE SPOKE FRENCH PERFECTLY I HAVE BEEN TOLD WHEN NEED WAS BUT DELIGHTED USUALLY IN TALKING THE BROADEST YORKSHIRE
AND SO LIFE AND DEATH HAVE DISPERSED THE CIRCLE OF VIOLENT RADICALS AND DISSENTERS INTO WHICH TWENTY YEARS AGO THE LITTLE QUIET RESOLUTE CLERGYMAN'S DAUGHTER WAS RECEIVED AND BY WHOM SHE WAS TRULY LOVED AND HONOURED
JANUARY AND FEBRUARY OF EIGHTEEN THIRTY SEVEN HAD PASSED AWAY AND STILL THERE WAS NO REPLY FROM SOUTHEY
I AM NOT DEPRECIATING IT WHEN I SAY THAT IN THESE TIMES IT IS NOT RARE
BUT IT IS NOT WITH A VIEW TO DISTINCTION THAT YOU SHOULD CULTIVATE THIS TALENT IF YOU CONSULT YOUR OWN HAPPINESS
YOU WILL SAY THAT A WOMAN HAS NO NEED OF SUCH A CAUTION THERE CAN BE NO PERIL IN IT FOR HER
THE MORE SHE IS ENGAGED IN HER PROPER DUTIES THE LESS LEISURE WILL SHE HAVE FOR IT EVEN AS AN ACCOMPLISHMENT AND A RECREATION
TO THOSE DUTIES YOU HAVE NOT YET BEEN CALLED AND WHEN YOU ARE YOU WILL BE LESS EAGER FOR CELEBRITY
BUT DO NOT SUPPOSE THAT I DISPARAGE THE GIFT WHICH YOU POSSESS NOR THAT I WOULD DISCOURAGE YOU FROM EXERCISING IT I ONLY EXHORT YOU SO TO THINK OF IT AND SO TO USE IT AS TO RENDER IT CONDUCIVE TO YOUR OWN PERMANENT GOOD
FAREWELL MADAM
THOUGH I MAY BE BUT AN UNGRACIOUS ADVISER YOU WILL ALLOW ME THEREFORE TO SUBSCRIBE MYSELF WITH THE BEST WISHES FOR YOUR HAPPINESS HERE AND HEREAFTER YOUR TRUE FRIEND ROBERT SOUTHEY
SIR MARCH SIXTEENTH
I HAD NOT VENTURED TO HOPE FOR SUCH A REPLY SO CONSIDERATE IN ITS TONE SO NOBLE IN ITS SPIRIT
I KNOW THE FIRST LETTER I WROTE TO YOU WAS ALL SENSELESS TRASH FROM BEGINNING TO END BUT I AM NOT ALTOGETHER THE IDLE DREAMING BEING IT WOULD SEEM TO DENOTE
I THOUGHT IT THEREFORE MY DUTY WHEN I LEFT SCHOOL TO BECOME A GOVERNESS
IN THE EVENINGS I CONFESS I DO THINK BUT I NEVER TROUBLE ANY ONE ELSE WITH MY THOUGHTS
I CAREFULLY AVOID ANY APPEARANCE OF PREOCCUPATION AND ECCENTRICITY WHICH MIGHT LEAD THOSE I LIVE AMONGST TO SUSPECT THE NATURE OF MY PURSUITS
I DON'T ALWAYS SUCCEED FOR SOMETIMES WHEN I'M TEACHING OR SEWING I WOULD RATHER BE READING OR WRITING BUT I TRY TO DENY MYSELF AND MY FATHER'S APPROBATION AMPLY REWARDED ME FOR THE PRIVATION
AGAIN I THANK YOU THIS INCIDENT I SUPPOSE WILL BE RENEWED NO MORE IF I LIVE TO BE AN OLD WOMAN I SHALL REMEMBER IT THIRTY YEARS HENCE AS A BRIGHT DREAM
P S PRAY SIR EXCUSE ME FOR WRITING TO YOU A SECOND TIME I COULD NOT HELP WRITING PARTLY TO TELL YOU HOW THANKFUL I AM FOR YOUR KINDNESS AND PARTLY TO LET YOU KNOW THAT YOUR ADVICE SHALL NOT BE WASTED HOWEVER SORROWFULLY AND RELUCTANTLY IT MAY BE AT FIRST FOLLOWED C B
I CANNOT DENY MYSELF THE GRATIFICATION OF INSERTING SOUTHEY'S REPLY
KESWICK MARCH TWENTY SECOND EIGHTEEN THIRTY SEVEN DEAR MADAM
YOUR LETTER HAS GIVEN ME GREAT PLEASURE AND I SHOULD NOT FORGIVE MYSELF IF I DID NOT TELL YOU SO
OF THIS SECOND LETTER ALSO SHE SPOKE AND TOLD ME THAT IT CONTAINED AN INVITATION FOR HER TO GO AND SEE THE POET IF EVER SHE VISITED THE LAKES
ON AUGUST TWENTY SEVENTH EIGHTEEN THIRTY SEVEN SHE WRITES
COME COME I AM GETTING REALLY TIRED OF YOUR ABSENCE
SATURDAY AFTER SATURDAY COMES ROUND AND I CAN HAVE NO HOPE OF HEARING YOUR KNOCK AT THE DOOR AND THEN BEING TOLD THAT MISS E IS COME OH DEAR
IN THIS MONOTONOUS LIFE OF MINE THAT WAS A PLEASANT EVENT
I WISH IT WOULD RECUR AGAIN BUT IT WILL TAKE TWO OR THREE INTERVIEWS BEFORE THE STIFFNESS THE ESTRANGEMENT OF THIS LONG SEPARATION WILL WEAR AWAY
MY EYES FILL WITH TEARS WHEN I CONTRAST THE BLISS OF SUCH A STATE BRIGHTENED BY HOPES OF THE FUTURE WITH THE MELANCHOLY STATE I NOW LIVE IN UNCERTAIN THAT I EVER FELT TRUE CONTRITION WANDERING IN THOUGHT AND DEED LONGING FOR HOLINESS WHICH I SHALL NEVER NEVER OBTAIN SMITTEN AT TIMES TO THE HEART WITH THE CONVICTION THAT GHASTLY CALVINISTIC DOCTRINES ARE TRUE DARKENED IN SHORT BY THE VERY SHADOWS OF SPIRITUAL DEATH
IF CHRISTIAN PERFECTION BE NECESSARY TO SALVATION I SHALL NEVER BE SAVED MY HEART IS A VERY HOTBED FOR SINFUL THOUGHTS AND WHEN I DECIDE ON AN ACTION I SCARCELY REMEMBER TO LOOK TO MY REDEEMER FOR DIRECTION
AND MEANTIME I KNOW THE GREATNESS OF JEHOVAH I ACKNOWLEDGE THE PERFECTION OF HIS WORD I ADORE THE PURITY OF THE CHRISTIAN FAITH MY THEORY IS RIGHT MY PRACTICE HORRIBLY WRONG
THE CHRISTMAS HOLIDAYS CAME AND SHE AND ANNE RETURNED TO THE PARSONAGE AND TO THAT HAPPY HOME CIRCLE IN WHICH ALONE THEIR NATURES EXPANDED AMONGST ALL OTHER PEOPLE THEY SHRIVELLED UP MORE OR LESS
INDEED THERE WERE ONLY ONE OR TWO STRANGERS WHO COULD BE ADMITTED AMONG THE SISTERS WITHOUT PRODUCING THE SAME RESULT
SHE WAS GONE OUT INTO THE VILLAGE ON SOME ERRAND WHEN AS SHE WAS DESCENDING THE STEEP STREET HER FOOT SLIPPED ON THE ICE AND SHE FELL IT WAS DARK AND NO ONE SAW HER MISCHANCE TILL AFTER A TIME HER GROANS ATTRACTED THE ATTENTION OF A PASSER BY
UNFORTUNATELY THE FRACTURE COULD NOT BE SET TILL SIX O'CLOCK THE NEXT MORNING AS NO SURGEON WAS TO BE HAD BEFORE THAT TIME AND SHE NOW LIES AT OUR HOUSE IN A VERY DOUBTFUL AND DANGEROUS STATE
HOWEVER REMEMBERING WHAT YOU TOLD ME NAMELY THAT YOU HAD COMMENDED THE MATTER TO A HIGHER DECISION THAN OURS AND THAT YOU WERE RESOLVED TO SUBMIT WITH RESIGNATION TO THAT DECISION WHATEVER IT MIGHT BE I HOLD IT MY DUTY TO YIELD ALSO AND TO BE SILENT IT MAY BE ALL FOR THE BEST
AFTER THIS DISAPPOINTMENT I NEVER DARE RECKON WITH CERTAINTY ON THE ENJOYMENT OF A PLEASURE AGAIN IT SEEMS AS IF SOME FATALITY STOOD BETWEEN YOU AND ME
I AM NOT GOOD ENOUGH FOR YOU AND YOU MUST BE KEPT FROM THE CONTAMINATION OF TOO INTIMATE SOCIETY
A GOOD NEIGHBOUR OF THE BRONTES A CLEVER INTELLIGENT YORKSHIRE WOMAN WHO KEEPS A DRUGGIST'S SHOP IN HAWORTH AND FROM HER OCCUPATION HER EXPERIENCE AND EXCELLENT SENSE HOLDS THE POSITION OF VILLAGE DOCTRESS AND NURSE AND AS SUCH HAS BEEN A FRIEND IN MANY A TIME OF TRIAL AND SICKNESS AND DEATH IN THE HOUSEHOLDS ROUND TOLD ME A CHARACTERISTIC LITTLE INCIDENT CONNECTED WITH TABBY'S FRACTURED LEG
TABBY HAD LIVED WITH THEM FOR TEN OR TWELVE YEARS AND WAS AS CHARLOTTE EXPRESSED IT ONE OF THE FAMILY
HE REFUSED AT FIRST TO LISTEN TO THE CAREFUL ADVICE IT WAS REPUGNANT TO HIS LIBERAL NATURE
THIS DECISION WAS COMMUNICATED TO THE GIRLS
TABBY HAD TENDED THEM IN THEIR CHILDHOOD THEY AND NONE OTHER SHOULD TEND HER IN HER INFIRMITY AND AGE
AT TEA TIME THEY WERE SAD AND SILENT AND THE MEAL WENT AWAY UNTOUCHED BY ANY OF THE THREE
SHE HAD ANOTHER WEIGHT ON HER MIND THIS CHRISTMAS
BUT ANNE HAD BEGUN TO SUFFER JUST BEFORE THE HOLIDAYS AND CHARLOTTE WATCHED OVER HER YOUNGER SISTERS WITH THE JEALOUS VIGILANCE OF SOME WILD CREATURE THAT CHANGES HER VERY NATURE IF DANGER THREATENS HER YOUNG
STUNG BY ANXIETY FOR THIS LITTLE SISTER SHE UPBRAIDED MISS W FOR HER FANCIED INDIFFERENCE TO ANNE'S STATE OF HEALTH
STILL HER HEART HAD RECEIVED A SHOCK IN THE PERCEPTION OF ANNE'S DELICACY AND ALL THESE HOLIDAYS SHE WATCHED OVER HER WITH THE LONGING FOND ANXIETY WHICH IS SO FULL OF SUDDEN PANGS OF FEAR
I DOUBT WHETHER BRANWELL WAS MAINTAINING HIMSELF AT THIS TIME
EVERY ONE COULD OBSERVE HIS AGITATION AND PROSTRATION A PROSTRATION WHICH WAS INDEED THE MORE REMARKABLE SINCE PEOPLE WERE NOT ACCUSTOMED TO SEE HIM WITH HIS ARMS HANGING LISTLESSLY BY HIS SIDE HIS HEAD BEWILDERED AND HIS EYES WITH ALL THEIR BRIGHT INTELLIGENCE BEDIMMED
UPON THIS MADAME DEIGNED TO TURN HER EYES LANGUISHINGLY TOWARDS THE COMTE OBSERVING
DO YOU THINK SO SHE REPLIED WITH INDIFFERENCE
YES THE CHARACTER WHICH YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS ASSUMED IS IN PERFECT HARMONY WITH YOUR OWN
EXPLAIN YOURSELF
I ALLUDE TO THE GODDESS
THE PRINCESS INQUIRED NO
SHE THEN ROSE HUMMING THE AIR TO WHICH SHE WAS PRESENTLY GOING TO DANCE
THE ARROW PIERCED HIS HEART AND WOUNDED HIM MORTALLY
A QUARTER OF AN HOUR AFTERWARDS HE RETURNED TO THE THEATER BUT IT WILL BE READILY BELIEVED THAT IT WAS ONLY A POWERFUL EFFORT OF REASON OVER HIS GREAT EXCITEMENT THAT ENABLED HIM TO GO BACK OR PERHAPS FOR LOVE IS THUS STRANGELY CONSTITUTED HE FOUND IT IMPOSSIBLE EVEN TO REMAIN MUCH LONGER SEPARATED FROM THE PRESENCE OF ONE WHO HAD BROKEN HIS HEART
WHEN SHE PERCEIVED THE YOUNG MAN SHE ROSE LIKE A WOMAN SURPRISED IN THE MIDST OF IDEAS SHE WAS DESIROUS OF CONCEALING FROM HERSELF
REMAIN I IMPLORE YOU THE EVENING IS MOST LOVELY
INDEED AH
I REMEMBER NOW AND I CONGRATULATE MYSELF DO YOU LOVE ANY ONE
FORGIVE ME I HARDLY KNOW WHAT I AM SAYING A THOUSAND TIMES FORGIVE ME MADAME WAS RIGHT QUITE RIGHT THIS BRUTAL EXILE HAS COMPLETELY TURNED MY BRAIN
THERE CANNOT BE A DOUBT HE RECEIVED YOU KINDLY FOR IN FACT YOU RETURNED WITHOUT HIS PERMISSION
OH MADEMOISELLE WHY HAVE I NOT A DEVOTED SISTER OR A TRUE FRIEND SUCH AS YOURSELF
WHAT ALREADY HERE THEY SAID TO HER
I HAVE BEEN HERE THIS QUARTER OF AN HOUR REPLIED LA VALLIERE
DID NOT THE DANCING AMUSE YOU NO
NO MORE THAN THE DANCING
LA VALLIERE IS QUITE A POETESS SAID TONNAY CHARENTE
I AM A WOMAN AND THERE ARE FEW LIKE ME WHOEVER LOVES ME FLATTERS ME WHOEVER FLATTERS ME PLEASES ME AND WHOEVER PLEASES WELL SAID MONTALAIS YOU DO NOT FINISH
IT IS TOO DIFFICULT REPLIED MADEMOISELLE DE TONNAY CHARENTE LAUGHING LOUDLY
LOOK YONDER DO YOU NOT SEE THE MOON SLOWLY RISING SILVERING THE TOPMOST BRANCHES OF THE CHESTNUTS AND THE OAKS
EXQUISITE SOFT TURF OF THE WOODS THE HAPPINESS WHICH YOUR FRIENDSHIP CONFERS UPON ME
WELL SAID MADEMOISELLE DE TONNAY CHARENTE I ALSO THINK A GOOD DEAL BUT I TAKE CARE
TO SAY NOTHING SAID MONTALAIS SO THAT WHEN MADEMOISELLE DE TONNAY CHARENTE THINKS ATHENAIS IS THE ONLY ONE WHO KNOWS IT
QUICK QUICK THEN AMONG THE HIGH REED GRASS SAID MONTALAIS STOOP ATHENAIS YOU ARE SO TALL
THE YOUNG GIRLS HAD INDEED MADE THEMSELVES SMALL INDEED INVISIBLE
SHE WAS HERE JUST NOW SAID THE COUNT
YOU ARE POSITIVE THEN
YES BUT PERHAPS I FRIGHTENED HER IN WHAT WAY
HOW IS IT LA VALLIERE SAID MADEMOISELLE DE TONNAY CHARENTE THAT THE VICOMTE DE BRAGELONNE SPOKE OF YOU AS LOUISE
IT SEEMS THE KING WILL NOT CONSENT TO IT
GOOD GRACIOUS HAS THE KING ANY RIGHT TO INTERFERE IN MATTERS OF THAT KIND
I GIVE MY CONSENT
OH I AM SPEAKING SERIOUSLY REPLIED MONTALAIS AND MY OPINION IN THIS CASE IS QUITE AS GOOD AS THE KING'S I SUPPOSE IS IT NOT LOUISE
LET US RUN THEN SAID ALL THREE AND GRACEFULLY LIFTING UP THE LONG SKIRTS OF THEIR SILK DRESSES THEY LIGHTLY RAN ACROSS THE OPEN SPACE BETWEEN THE LAKE AND THE THICKEST COVERT OF THE PARK
IN FACT THE SOUND OF MADAME'S AND THE QUEEN'S CARRIAGES COULD BE HEARD IN THE DISTANCE UPON THE HARD DRY GROUND OF THE ROADS FOLLOWED BY THE MOUNTED CAVALIERS
IN THIS WAY THE FETE OF THE WHOLE COURT WAS A FETE ALSO FOR THE MYSTERIOUS INHABITANTS OF THE FOREST FOR CERTAINLY THE DEER IN THE BRAKE THE PHEASANT ON THE BRANCH THE FOX IN ITS HOLE WERE ALL LISTENING
AT THE CONCLUSION OF THE BANQUET WHICH WAS SERVED AT FIVE O'CLOCK THE KING ENTERED HIS CABINET WHERE HIS TAILORS WERE AWAITING HIM FOR THE PURPOSE OF TRYING ON THE CELEBRATED COSTUME REPRESENTING SPRING WHICH WAS THE RESULT OF SO MUCH IMAGINATION AND HAD COST SO MANY EFFORTS OF THOUGHT TO THE DESIGNERS AND ORNAMENT WORKERS OF THE COURT
AH VERY WELL
LET HIM COME IN THEN SAID THE KING AND AS IF COLBERT HAD BEEN LISTENING AT THE DOOR FOR THE PURPOSE OF KEEPING HIMSELF AU COURANT WITH THE CONVERSATION HE ENTERED AS SOON AS THE KING HAD PRONOUNCED HIS NAME TO THE TWO COURTIERS
GENTLEMEN TO YOUR POSTS WHEREUPON SAINT AIGNAN AND VILLEROY TOOK THEIR LEAVE
CERTAINLY SIRE BUT I MUST HAVE MONEY TO DO THAT WHAT
WHAT DO YOU MEAN INQUIRED LOUIS
HE HAS GIVEN THEM WITH TOO MUCH GRACE NOT TO HAVE OTHERS STILL TO GIVE IF THEY ARE REQUIRED WHICH IS THE CASE AT THE PRESENT MOMENT
IT IS NECESSARY THEREFORE THAT HE SHOULD COMPLY THE KING FROWNED
DOES YOUR MAJESTY THEN NO LONGER BELIEVE THE DISLOYAL ATTEMPT
NOT AT ALL YOU ARE ON THE CONTRARY MOST AGREEABLE TO ME
YOUR MAJESTY'S PLAN THEN IN THIS AFFAIR IS
YOU WILL TAKE THEM FROM MY PRIVATE TREASURE
THE NEWS CIRCULATED WITH THE RAPIDITY OF LIGHTNING DURING ITS PROGRESS IT KINDLED EVERY VARIETY OF COQUETRY DESIRE AND WILD AMBITION
THE KING HAD COMPLETED HIS TOILETTE BY NINE O'CLOCK HE APPEARED IN AN OPEN CARRIAGE DECORATED WITH BRANCHES OF TREES AND FLOWERS
THE QUEENS HAD TAKEN THEIR SEATS UPON A MAGNIFICENT DIAS OR PLATFORM ERECTED UPON THE BORDERS OF THE LAKE IN A THEATER OF WONDERFUL ELEGANCE OF CONSTRUCTION
SUDDENLY FOR THE PURPOSE OF RESTORING PEACE AND ORDER SPRING ACCOMPANIED BY HIS WHOLE COURT MADE HIS APPEARANCE
THE SEASONS ALLIES OF SPRING FOLLOWED HIM CLOSELY TO FORM A QUADRILLE WHICH AFTER MANY WORDS OF MORE OR LESS FLATTERING IMPORT WAS THE COMMENCEMENT OF THE DANCE
HIS LEGS THE BEST SHAPED AT COURT WERE DISPLAYED TO GREAT ADVANTAGE IN FLESH COLORED SILKEN HOSE OF SILK SO FINE AND SO TRANSPARENT THAT IT SEEMED ALMOST LIKE FLESH ITSELF
THERE WAS SOMETHING IN HIS CARRIAGE WHICH RESEMBLED THE BUOYANT MOVEMENTS OF AN IMMORTAL AND HE DID NOT DANCE SO MUCH AS SEEM TO SOAR ALONG
YES IT IS SUPPRESSED
FAR FROM IT SIRE YOUR MAJESTY HAVING GIVEN NO DIRECTIONS ABOUT IT THE MUSICIANS HAVE RETAINED IT
YES SIRE AND READY DRESSED FOR THE BALLET
SIRE HE SAID YOUR MAJESTY'S MOST DEVOTED SERVANT APPROACHES TO PERFORM A SERVICE ON THIS OCCASION WITH SIMILAR ZEAL THAT HE HAS ALREADY SHOWN ON THE FIELD OF BATTLE
THE KING SEEMED ONLY PLEASED WITH EVERY ONE PRESENT
MONSIEUR WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO DID NOT UNDERSTAND ANYTHING ABOUT THE MATTER
THE BALLET BEGAN THE EFFECT WAS MORE THAN BEAUTIFUL
WHEN THE MUSIC BY ITS BURSTS OF MELODY CARRIED AWAY THESE ILLUSTRIOUS DANCERS WHEN THE SIMPLE UNTUTORED PANTOMIME OF THAT PERIOD ONLY THE MORE NATURAL ON ACCOUNT OF THE VERY INDIFFERENT ACTING OF THE AUGUST ACTORS HAD REACHED ITS CULMINATING POINT OF TRIUMPH THE THEATER SHOOK WITH TUMULTUOUS APPLAUSE
DISDAINFUL OF A SUCCESS OF WHICH MADAME SHOWED NO ACKNOWLEDGEMENT HE THOUGHT OF NOTHING BUT BOLDLY REGAINING THE MARKED PREFERENCE OF THE PRINCESS
BY DEGREES ALL HIS HAPPINESS ALL HIS BRILLIANCY SUBSIDED INTO REGRET AND UNEASINESS SO THAT HIS LIMBS LOST THEIR POWER HIS ARMS HUNG HEAVILY BY HIS SIDES AND HIS HEAD DROOPED AS THOUGH HE WAS STUPEFIED
THE KING WHO HAD FROM THIS MOMENT BECOME IN REALITY THE PRINCIPAL DANCER IN THE QUADRILLE CAST A LOOK UPON HIS VANQUISHED RIVAL
HE PASSES ABRUPTLY FROM PERSONS TO IDEAS AND NUMBERS AND FROM IDEAS AND NUMBERS TO PERSONS FROM THE HEAVENS TO MAN FROM ASTRONOMY TO PHYSIOLOGY HE CONFUSES OR RATHER DOES NOT DISTINGUISH SUBJECT AND OBJECT FIRST AND FINAL CAUSES AND IS DREAMING OF GEOMETRICAL FIGURES LOST IN A FLUX OF SENSE
THE INFLUENCE WITH THE TIMAEUS HAS EXERCISED UPON POSTERITY IS DUE PARTLY TO A MISUNDERSTANDING
IN THE SUPPOSED DEPTHS OF THIS DIALOGUE THE NEO PLATONISTS FOUND HIDDEN MEANINGS AND CONNECTIONS WITH THE JEWISH AND CHRISTIAN SCRIPTURES AND OUT OF THEM THEY ELICITED DOCTRINES QUITE AT VARIANCE WITH THE SPIRIT OF PLATO
THEY WERE ABSORBED IN HIS THEOLOGY AND WERE UNDER THE DOMINION OF HIS NAME WHILE THAT WHICH WAS TRULY GREAT AND TRULY CHARACTERISTIC IN HIM HIS EFFORT TO REALIZE AND CONNECT ABSTRACTIONS WAS NOT UNDERSTOOD BY THEM AT ALL
THERE IS NO DANGER OF THE MODERN COMMENTATORS ON THE TIMAEUS FALLING INTO THE ABSURDITIES OF THE NEO PLATONISTS
IN THE PRESENT DAY WE ARE WELL AWARE THAT AN ANCIENT PHILOSOPHER IS TO BE INTERPRETED FROM HIMSELF AND BY THE CONTEMPORARY HISTORY OF THOUGHT
THE FANCIES OF THE NEO PLATONISTS ARE ONLY INTERESTING TO US BECAUSE THEY EXHIBIT A PHASE OF THE HUMAN MIND WHICH PREVAILED WIDELY IN THE FIRST CENTURIES OF THE CHRISTIAN ERA AND IS NOT WHOLLY EXTINCT IN OUR OWN DAY
BUT THEY HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THE INTERPRETATION OF PLATO AND IN SPIRIT THEY ARE OPPOSED TO HIM
WE DO NOT KNOW HOW PLATO WOULD HAVE ARRANGED HIS OWN DIALOGUES OR WHETHER THE THOUGHT OF ARRANGING ANY OF THEM BESIDES THE TWO TRILOGIES WHICH HE HAS EXPRESSLY CONNECTED WAS EVER PRESENT TO HIS MIND
THE DIALOGUE IS PRIMARILY CONCERNED WITH THE ANIMAL CREATION INCLUDING UNDER THIS TERM THE HEAVENLY BODIES AND WITH MAN ONLY AS ONE AMONG THE ANIMALS
BUT HE HAS NOT AS YET DEFINED THIS INTERMEDIATE TERRITORY WHICH LIES SOMEWHERE BETWEEN MEDICINE AND MATHEMATICS AND HE WOULD HAVE FELT THAT THERE WAS AS GREAT AN IMPIETY IN RANKING THEORIES OF PHYSICS FIRST IN THE ORDER OF KNOWLEDGE AS IN PLACING THE BODY BEFORE THE SOUL
WITH HERACLEITUS HE ACKNOWLEDGES THE PERPETUAL FLUX LIKE ANAXAGORAS HE ASSERTS THE PREDOMINANCE OF MIND ALTHOUGH ADMITTING AN ELEMENT OF NECESSITY WHICH REASON IS INCAPABLE OF SUBDUING LIKE THE PYTHAGOREANS HE SUPPOSES THE MYSTERY OF THE WORLD TO BE CONTAINED IN NUMBER
MANY IF NOT ALL THE ELEMENTS OF THE PRE SOCRATIC PHILOSOPHY ARE INCLUDED IN THE TIMAEUS
IT IS PROBABLE THAT THE RELATION OF THE IDEAS TO GOD OR OF GOD TO THE WORLD WAS DIFFERENTLY CONCEIVED BY HIM AT DIFFERENT TIMES OF HIS LIFE
THE IDEAS ALSO REMAIN BUT THEY HAVE BECOME TYPES IN NATURE FORMS OF MEN ANIMALS BIRDS FISHES
THE STYLE AND PLAN OF THE TIMAEUS DIFFER GREATLY FROM THAT OF ANY OTHER OF THE PLATONIC DIALOGUES
BUT PLATO HAS NOT THE SAME MASTERY OVER HIS INSTRUMENT WHICH HE EXHIBITS IN THE PHAEDRUS OR SYMPOSIUM
NOTHING CAN EXCEED THE BEAUTY OR ART OF THE INTRODUCTION IN WHICH HE IS USING WORDS AFTER HIS ACCUSTOMED MANNER
BUT IN THE REST OF THE WORK THE POWER OF LANGUAGE SEEMS TO FAIL HIM AND THE DRAMATIC FORM IS WHOLLY GIVEN UP
HE COULD WRITE IN ONE STYLE BUT NOT IN ANOTHER AND THE GREEK LANGUAGE HAD NOT AS YET BEEN FASHIONED BY ANY POET OR PHILOSOPHER TO DESCRIBE PHYSICAL PHENOMENA
AND HENCE WE FIND THE SAME SORT OF CLUMSINESS IN THE TIMAEUS OF PLATO WHICH CHARACTERIZES THE PHILOSOPHICAL POEM OF LUCRETIUS
THERE IS A WANT OF FLOW AND OFTEN A DEFECT OF RHYTHM THE MEANING IS SOMETIMES OBSCURE AND THERE IS A GREATER USE OF APPOSITION AND MORE OF REPETITION THAN OCCURS IN PLATO'S EARLIER WRITINGS
PLATO HAD NOT THE COMMAND OF HIS MATERIALS WHICH WOULD HAVE ENABLED HIM TO PRODUCE A PERFECT WORK OF ART
SOCRATES BEGINS THE TIMAEUS WITH A SUMMARY OF THE REPUBLIC
AND NOW HE DESIRES TO SEE THE IDEAL STATE SET IN MOTION HE WOULD LIKE TO KNOW HOW SHE BEHAVED IN SOME GREAT STRUGGLE
AND THEREFORE TO YOU I TURN TIMAEUS CITIZEN OF LOCRIS WHO ARE AT ONCE A PHILOSOPHER AND A STATESMAN AND TO YOU CRITIAS WHOM ALL ATHENIANS KNOW TO BE SIMILARLY ACCOMPLISHED AND TO HERMOCRATES WHO IS ALSO FITTED BY NATURE AND EDUCATION TO SHARE IN OUR DISCOURSE
I WILL IF TIMAEUS APPROVES I APPROVE
LISTEN THEN SOCRATES TO A TALE OF SOLON'S WHO BEING THE FRIEND OF DROPIDAS MY GREAT GRANDFATHER TOLD IT TO MY GRANDFATHER CRITIAS AND HE TOLD ME
SOME POEMS OF SOLON WERE RECITED BY THE BOYS
AND WHAT WAS THE SUBJECT OF THE POEM SAID THE PERSON WHO MADE THE REMARK
THE SUBJECT WAS A VERY NOBLE ONE HE DESCRIBED THE MOST FAMOUS ACTION IN WHICH THE ATHENIAN PEOPLE WERE EVER ENGAGED
BUT THE MEMORY OF THEIR EXPLOITS HAS PASSED AWAY OWING TO THE LAPSE OF TIME AND THE EXTINCTION OF THE ACTORS
TELL US SAID THE OTHER THE WHOLE STORY AND WHERE SOLON HEARD THE STORY
BUT IN EGYPT THE TRADITIONS OF OUR OWN AND OTHER LANDS ARE BY US REGISTERED FOR EVER IN OUR TEMPLES
THE GENEALOGIES WHICH YOU HAVE RECITED TO US OUT OF YOUR OWN ANNALS SOLON ARE A MERE CHILDREN'S STORY
FOR IN THE TIMES BEFORE THE GREAT FLOOD ATHENS WAS THE GREATEST AND BEST OF CITIES AND DID THE NOBLEST DEEDS AND HAD THE BEST CONSTITUTION OF ANY UNDER THE FACE OF HEAVEN
SOLON MARVELLED AND DESIRED TO BE INFORMED OF THE PARTICULARS
NINE THOUSAND YEARS HAVE ELAPSED SINCE SHE FOUNDED YOURS AND EIGHT THOUSAND SINCE SHE FOUNDED OURS AS OUR ANNALS RECORD
MANY LAWS EXIST AMONG US WHICH ARE THE COUNTERPART OF YOURS AS THEY WERE IN THE OLDEN TIME
I WILL BRIEFLY DESCRIBE THEM TO YOU AND YOU SHALL READ THE ACCOUNT OF THEM AT YOUR LEISURE IN THE SACRED REGISTERS
OBSERVE AGAIN WHAT CARE THE LAW TOOK IN THE PURSUIT OF WISDOM SEARCHING OUT THE DEEP THINGS OF THE WORLD AND APPLYING THEM TO THE USE OF MAN
THE MOST FAMOUS OF THEM ALL WAS THE OVERTHROW OF THE ISLAND OF ATLANTIS
FOR AT THE PERIL OF HER OWN EXISTENCE AND WHEN THE OTHER HELLENES HAD DESERTED HER SHE REPELLED THE INVADER AND OF HER OWN ACCORD GAVE LIBERTY TO ALL THE NATIONS WITHIN THE PILLARS
THIS IS THE EXPLANATION OF THE SHALLOWS WHICH ARE FOUND IN THAT PART OF THE ATLANTIC OCEAN
BUT I WOULD NOT SPEAK AT THE TIME BECAUSE I WANTED TO REFRESH MY MEMORY
THEN NOW LET ME EXPLAIN TO YOU THE ORDER OF OUR ENTERTAINMENT FIRST TIMAEUS WHO IS A NATURAL PHILOSOPHER WILL SPEAK OF THE ORIGIN OF THE WORLD GOING DOWN TO THE CREATION OF MAN AND THEN I SHALL RECEIVE THE MEN WHOM HE HAS CREATED AND SOME OF WHOM WILL HAVE BEEN EDUCATED BY YOU AND INTRODUCE THEM TO YOU AS THE LOST ATHENIAN CITIZENS OF WHOM THE EGYPTIAN RECORD SPOKE
THIS WAS WHAT DID THE MISCHIEF SO FAR AS THE RUNNING AWAY WAS CONCERNED
IT IS HARDLY NECESSARY TO SAY MORE OF THEM HERE
FROM THE MANNER IN WHICH HE EXPRESSED HIMSELF WITH REGARD TO ROBERT HOLLAN NO MAN IN THE WHOLE RANGE OF HIS RECOLLECTIONS WILL BE LONGER REMEMBERED THAN HE HIS ENTHRALMENT WHILE UNDER HOLLAN WILL HARDLY EVER BE FORGOTTEN
OF THIS PARTY EDWARD A BOY OF SEVENTEEN CALLED FORTH MUCH SYMPATHY HE TOO WAS CLAIMED BY HOLLAN
JOHN WESLEY COMBASH JACOB TAYLOR AND THOMAS EDWARD SKINNER
A FEW YEARS BACK ONE OF THEIR SLAVES A COACHMAN WAS KEPT ON THE COACH BOX ONE COLD NIGHT WHEN THEY WERE OUT AT A BALL UNTIL HE BECAME ALMOST FROZEN TO DEATH IN FACT HE DID DIE IN THE INFIRMARY FROM THE EFFECTS OF THE FROST ABOUT ONE WEEK AFTERWARDS
THE DOCTOR WHO ATTENDED THE INJURED CREATURE IN THIS CASE WAS SIMPLY TOLD THAT SHE SLIPPED AND FELL DOWN STAIRS AS SHE WAS COMING DOWN
ANOTHER CASE SAID JOHN WESLEY WAS A LITTLE GIRL HALF GROWN WHO WAS WASHING WINDOWS UP STAIRS ONE DAY AND UNLUCKILY FELL ASLEEP IN THE WINDOW AND IN THIS POSITION WAS FOUND BY HER MISTRESS IN A RAGE THE MISTRESS HIT HER A HEAVY SLAP KNOCKED HER OUT OF THE WINDOW AND SHE FELL TO THE PAVEMENT AND DIED IN A FEW HOURS FROM THE EFFECTS THEREOF
AS USUAL NOTHING WAS DONE IN THE WAY OF PUNISHMENT
I NEVER KNEW OF BUT ONE MAN WHO COULD EVER PLEASE HIM
HE WORKED ME VERY HARD HE WANTED TO BE BEATING ME ALL THE TIME
SHE WAS A LARGE HOMELY WOMAN THEY WERE COMMON WHITE PEOPLE WITH NO REPUTATION IN THE COMMUNITY
SUBSTANTIALLY THIS WAS JACOB'S UNVARNISHED DESCRIPTION OF HIS MASTER AND MISTRESS
AS TO HIS AGE AND ALSO THE NAME OF HIS MASTER JACOB'S STATEMENT VARIED SOMEWHAT FROM THE ADVERTISEMENT
OF STARTING I DIDN'T KNOW THE WAY TO COME
IT'S ALMOST BEYOND CONJECTURE
THIS REALITY BEGINS TO EXPLAIN THE DARK POWER AND OTHERWORLDLY FASCINATION OF TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES UNDER THE SEAS
FIRST AS A PARIS STOCKBROKER LATER AS A CELEBRATED AUTHOR AND YACHTSMAN HE WENT ON FREQUENT VOYAGES TO BRITAIN AMERICA THE MEDITERRANEAN
NEMO BUILDS A FABULOUS FUTURISTIC SUBMARINE THE NAUTILUS THEN CONDUCTS AN UNDERWATER CAMPAIGN OF VENGEANCE AGAINST HIS IMPERIALIST OPPRESSOR
IN ALL THE NOVEL HAD A DIFFICULT GESTATION
OTHER SUBTLETIES OCCUR INSIDE EACH EPISODE THE TEXTURES SPARKLING WITH WIT INFORMATION AND INSIGHT
HIS SPECIFICATIONS FOR AN OPEN SEA SUBMARINE AND A SELF CONTAINED DIVING SUIT WERE DECADES BEFORE THEIR TIME YET MODERN TECHNOLOGY BEARS THEM OUT TRIUMPHANTLY
EVEN THE SUPPORTING CAST IS SHREWDLY DRAWN PROFESSOR ARONNAX THE CAREER SCIENTIST CAUGHT IN AN ETHICAL CONFLICT CONSEIL THE COMPULSIVE CLASSIFIER WHO SUPPLIES HUMOROUS TAG LINES FOR VERNE'S FAST FACTS THE HARPOONER NED LAND A CREATURE OF CONSTANT APPETITES MAN AS HEROIC ANIMAL
BUT MUCH OF THE NOVEL'S BROODING POWER COMES FROM CAPTAIN NEMO
THIS COMPULSION LEADS NEMO INTO UGLY CONTRADICTIONS HE'S A FIGHTER FOR FREEDOM YET ALL WHO BOARD HIS SHIP ARE IMPRISONED THERE FOR GOOD HE WORKS TO SAVE LIVES BOTH HUMAN AND ANIMAL YET HE HIMSELF CREATES A HOLOCAUST HE DETESTS IMPERIALISM YET HE LAYS PERSONAL CLAIM TO THE SOUTH POLE
AND IN THIS LAST ACTION HE FALLS INTO THE CLASSIC SIN OF PRIDE
HE'S SWIFTLY PUNISHED
THE NAUTILUS NEARLY PERISHES IN THE ANTARCTIC AND NEMO SINKS INTO A GROWING DEPRESSION
FOR MANY THEN THIS BOOK HAS BEEN A SOURCE OF FASCINATION SURELY ONE OF THE MOST INFLUENTIAL NOVELS EVER WRITTEN AN INSPIRATION FOR SUCH SCIENTISTS AND DISCOVERERS AS ENGINEER SIMON LAKE OCEANOGRAPHER WILLIAM BEEBE POLAR TRAVELER SIR ERNEST SHACKLETON
FATHOM SIX FEET
GRAM ROUGHLY ONE TWENTY EIGHTH OF AN OUNCE

CHAPTER THREE AS MASTER WISHES
THREE SECONDS BEFORE THE ARRIVAL OF J B HOBSON'S LETTER I NO MORE DREAMED OF CHASING THE UNICORN THAN OF TRYING FOR THE NORTHWEST PASSAGE
EVEN SO I HAD JUST RETURNED FROM AN ARDUOUS JOURNEY EXHAUSTED AND BADLY NEEDING A REST
I WANTED NOTHING MORE THAN TO SEE MY COUNTRY AGAIN MY FRIENDS MY MODEST QUARTERS BY THE BOTANICAL GARDENS MY DEARLY BELOVED COLLECTIONS
BUT NOW NOTHING COULD HOLD ME BACK
CONSEIL WAS MY MANSERVANT
FROM RUBBING SHOULDERS WITH SCIENTISTS IN OUR LITTLE UNIVERSE BY THE BOTANICAL GARDENS THE BOY HAD COME TO KNOW A THING OR TWO
CLASSIFYING WAS EVERYTHING TO HIM SO HE KNEW NOTHING ELSE WELL VERSED IN THE THEORY OF CLASSIFICATION HE WAS POORLY VERSED IN ITS PRACTICAL APPLICATION AND I DOUBT THAT HE COULD TELL A SPERM WHALE FROM A BALEEN WHALE
AND YET WHAT A FINE GALLANT LAD
NOT ONCE DID HE COMMENT ON THE LENGTH OR THE HARDSHIPS OF A JOURNEY
NEVER DID HE OBJECT TO BUCKLING UP HIS SUITCASE FOR ANY COUNTRY WHATEVER CHINA OR THE CONGO NO MATTER HOW FAR OFF IT WAS
HE WENT HERE THERE AND EVERYWHERE IN PERFECT CONTENTMENT
PLEASE FORGIVE ME FOR THIS UNDERHANDED WAY OF ADMITTING I HAD TURNED FORTY
HE WAS A FANATIC ON FORMALITY AND HE ONLY ADDRESSED ME IN THE THIRD PERSON TO THE POINT WHERE IT GOT TIRESOME
THERE WAS GOOD REASON TO STOP AND THINK EVEN FOR THE WORLD'S MOST EMOTIONLESS MAN
CONSEIL I CALLED A THIRD TIME CONSEIL APPEARED
DID MASTER SUMMON ME HE SAID ENTERING
PACK AS MUCH INTO MY TRUNK AS YOU CAN MY TRAVELING KIT MY SUITS SHIRTS AND SOCKS DON'T BOTHER COUNTING JUST SQUEEZE IT ALL IN AND HURRY
WE'LL DEAL WITH THEM LATER WHAT
ANYHOW WE'LL LEAVE INSTRUCTIONS TO SHIP THE WHOLE MENAGERIE TO FRANCE
YES WE ARE CERTAINLY I REPLIED EVASIVELY BUT AFTER WE MAKE A DETOUR
A ROUTE SLIGHTLY LESS DIRECT THAT'S ALL
WE'RE LEAVING ON THE ABRAHAM LINCOLN
YOU SEE MY FRIEND IT'S AN ISSUE OF THE MONSTER THE NOTORIOUS NARWHALE
WE DON'T KNOW WHERE IT WILL TAKE US
BUT WE'RE GOING JUST THE SAME
WE HAVE A COMMANDER WHO'S GAME FOR ANYTHING
I LEFT INSTRUCTIONS FOR SHIPPING MY CONTAINERS OF STUFFED ANIMALS AND DRIED PLANTS TO PARIS FRANCE
I OPENED A LINE OF CREDIT SUFFICIENT TO COVER THE BABIRUSA AND CONSEIL AT MY HEELS I JUMPED INTO A CARRIAGE
OUR BAGGAGE WAS IMMEDIATELY CARRIED TO THE DECK OF THE FRIGATE I RUSHED ABOARD
I ASKED FOR COMMANDER FARRAGUT
ONE OF THE SAILORS LED ME TO THE AFTERDECK WHERE I STOOD IN THE PRESENCE OF A SMART LOOKING OFFICER WHO EXTENDED HIS HAND TO ME
IN PERSON WELCOME ABOARD PROFESSOR YOUR CABIN IS WAITING FOR YOU
I WAS WELL SATISFIED WITH MY CABIN WHICH WAS LOCATED IN THE STERN AND OPENED INTO THE OFFICERS MESS
WE'LL BE QUITE COMFORTABLE HERE I TOLD CONSEIL
AND SO IF I'D BEEN DELAYED BY A QUARTER OF AN HOUR OR EVEN LESS THE FRIGATE WOULD HAVE GONE WITHOUT ME AND I WOULD HAVE MISSED OUT ON THIS UNEARTHLY EXTRAORDINARY AND INCONCEIVABLE EXPEDITION WHOSE TRUE STORY MIGHT WELL MEET WITH SOME SKEPTICISM
THE WHARVES OF BROOKLYN AND EVERY PART OF NEW YORK BORDERING THE EAST RIVER WERE CROWDED WITH CURIOSITY SEEKERS
DEPARTING FROM FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND THROATS THREE CHEERS BURST FORTH IN SUCCESSION
THOUSANDS OF HANDKERCHIEFS WERE WAVING ABOVE THESE TIGHTLY PACKED MASSES HAILING THE ABRAHAM LINCOLN UNTIL IT REACHED THE WATERS OF THE HUDSON RIVER AT THE TIP OF THE LONG PENINSULA THAT FORMS NEW YORK CITY
THE ANALYSIS OF KNOWLEDGE WILL OCCUPY US UNTIL THE END OF THE THIRTEENTH LECTURE AND IS THE MOST DIFFICULT PART OF OUR WHOLE ENTERPRISE
WHAT IS CALLED PERCEPTION DIFFERS FROM SENSATION BY THE FACT THAT THE SENSATIONAL INGREDIENTS BRING UP HABITUAL ASSOCIATES IMAGES AND EXPECTATIONS OF THEIR USUAL CORRELATES ALL OF WHICH ARE SUBJECTIVELY INDISTINGUISHABLE FROM THE SENSATION
WHETHER OR NOT THIS PRINCIPLE IS LIABLE TO EXCEPTIONS EVERYONE WOULD AGREE THAT IS HAS A BROAD MEASURE OF TRUTH THOUGH THE WORD EXACTLY MIGHT SEEM AN OVERSTATEMENT AND IT MIGHT SEEM MORE CORRECT TO SAY THAT IDEAS APPROXIMATELY REPRESENT IMPRESSIONS
AND WHAT SORT OF EVIDENCE IS LOGICALLY POSSIBLE
THERE IS NO LOGICAL IMPOSSIBILITY IN THE HYPOTHESIS THAT THE WORLD SPRANG INTO BEING FIVE MINUTES AGO EXACTLY AS IT THEN WAS WITH A POPULATION THAT REMEMBERED A WHOLLY UNREAL PAST
ALL THAT I AM DOING IS TO USE ITS LOGICAL TENABILITY AS A HELP IN THE ANALYSIS OF WHAT OCCURS WHEN WE REMEMBER
THE BEHAVIOURIST WHO ATTEMPTS TO MAKE PSYCHOLOGY A RECORD OF BEHAVIOUR HAS TO TRUST HIS MEMORY IN MAKING THE RECORD
HABIT IS A CONCEPT INVOLVING THE OCCURRENCE OF SIMILAR EVENTS AT DIFFERENT TIMES IF THE BEHAVIOURIST FEELS CONFIDENT THAT THERE IS SUCH A PHENOMENON AS HABIT THAT CAN ONLY BE BECAUSE HE TRUSTS HIS MEMORY WHEN IT ASSURES HIM THAT THERE HAVE BEEN OTHER TIMES
BUT I DO NOT THINK SUCH AN INFERENCE IS WARRANTED
OUR CONFIDENCE OR LACK OF CONFIDENCE IN THE ACCURACY OF A MEMORY IMAGE MUST IN FUNDAMENTAL CASES BE BASED UPON A CHARACTERISTIC OF THE IMAGE ITSELF SINCE WE CANNOT EVOKE THE PAST BODILY AND COMPARE IT WITH THE PRESENT IMAGE
WE SOMETIMES HAVE IMAGES THAT ARE BY NO MEANS PECULIARLY VAGUE WHICH YET WE DO NOT TRUST FOR EXAMPLE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF FATIGUE WE MAY SEE A FRIEND'S FACE VIVIDLY AND CLEARLY BUT HORRIBLY DISTORTED
SOME IMAGES LIKE SOME SENSATIONS FEEL VERY FAMILIAR WHILE OTHERS FEEL STRANGE
FAMILIARITY IS A FEELING CAPABLE OF DEGREES
IN AN IMAGE OF A WELL KNOWN FACE FOR EXAMPLE SOME PARTS MAY FEEL MORE FAMILIAR THAN OTHERS WHEN THIS HAPPENS WE HAVE MORE BELIEF IN THE ACCURACY OF THE FAMILIAR PARTS THAN IN THAT OF THE UNFAMILIAR PARTS
I COME NOW TO THE OTHER CHARACTERISTIC WHICH MEMORY IMAGES MUST HAVE IN ORDER TO ACCOUNT FOR OUR KNOWLEDGE OF THE PAST
THEY MUST HAVE SOME CHARACTERISTIC WHICH MAKES US REGARD THEM AS REFERRING TO MORE OR LESS REMOTE PORTIONS OF THE PAST
IN ACTUAL FACT THERE ARE DOUBTLESS VARIOUS FACTORS THAT CONCUR IN GIVING US THE FEELING OF GREATER OR LESS REMOTENESS IN SOME REMEMBERED EVENT
THERE MAY BE A SPECIFIC FEELING WHICH COULD BE CALLED THE FEELING OF PASTNESS ESPECIALLY WHERE IMMEDIATE MEMORY IS CONCERNED
THERE IS OF COURSE A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN KNOWING THE TEMPORAL RELATION OF A REMEMBERED EVENT TO THE PRESENT AND KNOWING THE TIME ORDER OF TWO REMEMBERED EVENTS
IT WOULD SEEM THAT ONLY RATHER RECENT EVENTS CAN BE PLACED AT ALL ACCURATELY BY MEANS OF FEELINGS GIVING THEIR TEMPORAL RELATION TO THE PRESENT BUT IT IS CLEAR THAT SUCH FEELINGS MUST PLAY AN ESSENTIAL PART IN THE PROCESS OF DATING REMEMBERED EVENTS
IF WE HAD RETAINED THE SUBJECT OR ACT IN KNOWLEDGE THE WHOLE PROBLEM OF MEMORY WOULD HAVE BEEN COMPARATIVELY SIMPLE
REMEMBERING HAS TO BE A PRESENT OCCURRENCE IN SOME WAY RESEMBLING OR RELATED TO WHAT IS REMEMBERED
SOME POINTS MAY BE TAKEN AS FIXED AND SUCH AS ANY THEORY OF MEMORY MUST ARRIVE AT
IN THIS CASE AS IN MOST OTHERS WHAT MAY BE TAKEN AS CERTAIN IN ADVANCE IS RATHER VAGUE
THE FIRST OF OUR VAGUE BUT INDUBITABLE DATA IS THAT THERE IS KNOWLEDGE OF THE PAST
WE MIGHT PROVISIONALLY THOUGH PERHAPS NOT QUITE CORRECTLY DEFINE MEMORY AS THAT WAY OF KNOWING ABOUT THE PAST WHICH HAS NO ANALOGUE IN OUR KNOWLEDGE OF THE FUTURE SUCH A DEFINITION WOULD AT LEAST SERVE TO MARK THE PROBLEM WITH WHICH WE ARE CONCERNED THOUGH SOME EXPECTATIONS MAY DESERVE TO RANK WITH MEMORY AS REGARDS IMMEDIACY
THIS DISTINCTION IS VITAL TO THE UNDERSTANDING OF MEMORY BUT IT IS NOT SO EASY TO CARRY OUT IN PRACTICE AS IT IS TO DRAW IN THEORY
A GRAMOPHONE BY THE HELP OF SUITABLE RECORDS MIGHT RELATE TO US THE INCIDENTS OF ITS PAST AND PEOPLE ARE NOT SO DIFFERENT FROM GRAMOPHONES AS THEY LIKE TO BELIEVE
I CAN SET TO WORK NOW TO REMEMBER THINGS I NEVER REMEMBERED BEFORE SUCH AS WHAT I HAD TO EAT FOR BREAKFAST THIS MORNING AND IT CAN HARDLY BE WHOLLY HABIT THAT ENABLES ME TO DO THIS
THE FACT THAT A MAN CAN RECITE A POEM DOES NOT SHOW THAT HE REMEMBERS ANY PREVIOUS OCCASION ON WHICH HE HAS RECITED OR READ IT
SEMON'S TWO BOOKS MENTIONED IN AN EARLIER LECTURE DO NOT TOUCH KNOWLEDGE MEMORY AT ALL CLOSELY
THEY GIVE LAWS ACCORDING TO WHICH IMAGES OF PAST OCCURRENCES COME INTO OUR MINDS BUT DO NOT DISCUSS OUR BELIEF THAT THESE IMAGES REFER TO PAST OCCURRENCES WHICH IS WHAT CONSTITUTES KNOWLEDGE MEMORY
IT IS THIS THAT IS OF INTEREST TO THEORY OF KNOWLEDGE
IT IS BY NO MEANS ALWAYS RELIABLE ALMOST EVERYBODY HAS AT SOME TIME EXPERIENCED THE WELL KNOWN ILLUSION THAT ALL THAT IS HAPPENING NOW HAPPENED BEFORE AT SOME TIME
WHENEVER THE SENSE OF FAMILIARITY OCCURS WITHOUT A DEFINITE OBJECT IT LEADS US TO SEARCH THE ENVIRONMENT UNTIL WE ARE SATISFIED THAT WE HAVE FOUND THE APPROPRIATE OBJECT WHICH LEADS US TO THE JUDGMENT THIS IS FAMILIAR
THUS NO KNOWLEDGE AS TO THE PAST IS TO BE DERIVED FROM THE FEELING OF FAMILIARITY ALONE
A FURTHER STAGE IS RECOGNITION
RECOGNITION IN THIS SENSE DOES NOT NECESSARILY INVOLVE MORE THAN A HABIT OF ASSOCIATION THE KIND OF OBJECT WE ARE SEEING AT THE MOMENT IS ASSOCIATED WITH THE WORD CAT OR WITH AN AUDITORY IMAGE OF PURRING OR WHATEVER OTHER CHARACTERISTIC WE MAY HAPPEN TO RECOGNIZE IN THE CAT OF THE MOMENT
WE ARE OF COURSE IN FACT ABLE TO JUDGE WHEN WE RECOGNIZE AN OBJECT THAT WE HAVE SEEN IT BEFORE BUT THIS JUDGMENT IS SOMETHING OVER AND ABOVE RECOGNITION IN THIS FIRST SENSE AND MAY VERY PROBABLY BE IMPOSSIBLE TO ANIMALS THAT NEVERTHELESS HAVE THE EXPERIENCE OF RECOGNITION IN THIS FIRST SENSE OF THE WORD
THIS KNOWLEDGE IS MEMORY IN ONE SENSE THOUGH IN ANOTHER IT IS NOT
THERE ARE HOWEVER SEVERAL POINTS IN WHICH SUCH AN ACCOUNT OF RECOGNITION IS INADEQUATE TO BEGIN WITH IT MIGHT SEEM AT FIRST SIGHT MORE CORRECT TO DEFINE RECOGNITION AS I HAVE SEEN THIS BEFORE THAN AS THIS HAS EXISTED BEFORE
THE DEFINITION OF MY EXPERIENCE IS DIFFICULT BROADLY SPEAKING IT IS EVERYTHING THAT IS CONNECTED WITH WHAT I AM EXPERIENCING NOW BY CERTAIN LINKS OF WHICH THE VARIOUS FORMS OF MEMORY ARE AMONG THE MOST IMPORTANT
THUS IF I RECOGNIZE A THING THE OCCASION OF ITS PREVIOUS EXISTENCE IN VIRTUE OF WHICH I RECOGNIZE IT FORMS PART OF MY EXPERIENCE BY DEFINITION RECOGNITION WILL BE ONE OF THE MARKS BY WHICH MY EXPERIENCE IS SINGLED OUT FROM THE REST OF THE WORLD
OF COURSE THE WORDS THIS HAS EXISTED BEFORE ARE A VERY INADEQUATE TRANSLATION OF WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENS WHEN WE FORM A JUDGMENT OF RECOGNITION BUT THAT IS UNAVOIDABLE WORDS ARE FRAMED TO EXPRESS A LEVEL OF THOUGHT WHICH IS BY NO MEANS PRIMITIVE AND ARE QUITE INCAPABLE OF EXPRESSING SUCH AN ELEMENTARY OCCURRENCE AS RECOGNITION
HE IS A WELCOME FIGURE AT THE GARDEN PARTIES OF THE ELECT WHO ARE ALWAYS READY TO ENCOURAGE HIM BY ACCEPTING FREE SEATS FOR HIS PLAY ACTOR MANAGERS NOD TO HIM EDITORS ALLOW HIM TO CONTRIBUTE WITHOUT CHARGE TO A SYMPOSIUM ON THE PRICE OF GOLF BALLS
IN SHORT HE BECOMES A PROMINENT FIGURE IN LONDON SOCIETY AND IF HE IS NOT CAREFUL SOMEBODY WILL SAY SO
BUT EVEN THE UNSUCCESSFUL DRAMATIST HAS HIS MOMENTS
YOUR PLAY MUST BE NOT MERELY A GOOD PLAY BUT A SUCCESSFUL ONE
FRANKLY I CANNOT ALWAYS SAY
BUT SUPPOSE YOU SAID I'M FOND OF WRITING MY PEOPLE ALWAYS SAY MY LETTERS HOME ARE GOOD ENOUGH FOR PUNCH
I'VE GOT A LITTLE IDEA FOR A PLAY ABOUT A MAN AND A WOMAN AND ANOTHER WOMAN AND BUT PERHAPS I'D BETTER KEEP THE PLOT A SECRET FOR THE MOMENT
ANYHOW IT'S JOLLY EXCITING AND I CAN DO THE DIALOGUE ALL RIGHT
LEND ME YOUR EAR FOR TEN MINUTES AND YOU SHALL LEARN JUST WHAT STAGECRAFT IS
AND I SHOULD BEGIN WITH A SHORT HOMILY ON SOLILOQUY
HAM TO BE OR NOT TO BE
NOW THE OBJECT OF THIS SOLILOQUY IS PLAIN
INDEED IRRESOLUTION BEING THE KEYNOTE OF HAMLET'S SOLILOQUY A CLEVER PLAYER COULD TO SOME EXTENT INDICATE THE WHOLE THIRTY LINES BY A SILENT WORKING OF THE JAW BUT AT THE SAME TIME IT WOULD BE IDLE TO DENY THAT HE WOULD MISS THE FINER SHADES OF THE DRAMATIST'S MEANING
WE MODERNS HOWEVER SEE THE ABSURDITY OF IT
IF IT BE GRANTED FIRST THAT THE THOUGHTS OF A CERTAIN CHARACTER SHOULD BE KNOWN TO THE AUDIENCE AND SECONDLY THAT SOLILOQUY OR THE HABIT OF THINKING ALOUD IS IN OPPOSITION TO MODERN STAGE TECHNIQUE HOW SHALL A SOLILOQUY BE AVOIDED WITHOUT DAMAGE TO THE PLAY
AND SO ON TILL YOU GET TO THE END WHEN OPHELIA MIGHT SAY AH YES OR SOMETHING NON COMMITTAL OF THAT SORT
THIS WOULD BE AN EASY WAY OF DOING IT BUT IT WOULD NOT BE THE BEST WAY FOR THE REASON THAT IT IS TOO EASY TO CALL ATTENTION TO ITSELF
IN THE OLD BADLY MADE PLAY IT WAS FREQUENTLY NECESSARY FOR ONE OF THE CHARACTERS TO TAKE THE AUDIENCE INTO HIS CONFIDENCE
IN THE MODERN WELL CONSTRUCTED PLAY HE SIMPLY RINGS UP AN IMAGINARY CONFEDERATE AND TELLS HIM WHAT HE IS GOING TO DO COULD ANYTHING BE MORE NATURAL
I WANT DOUBLE NINE HAL LO
DOUBLE NINE TWO THREE ELSINORE DOUBLE NINE YES HALLO IS THAT YOU HORATIO HAMLET SPEAKING
I SAY I'VE BEEN WONDERING ABOUT THIS BUSINESS
TO BE OR NOT TO BE THAT IS THE QUESTION WHETHER TIS NOBLER IN THE MIND TO SUFFER THE SLINGS AND ARROWS WHAT NO HAMLET SPEAKING
YOU GAVE ME DOUBLE FIVE I WANT DOUBLE NINE HALLO IS THAT YOU HORATIO HAMLET SPEAKING
TO BE OR NOT TO BE THAT IS THE QUESTION WHETHER TIS NOBLER
IT IS TO LET HAMLET IF THAT HAPPEN TO BE THE NAME OF YOUR CHARACTER ENTER WITH A SMALL DOG PET FALCON MONGOOSE TAME BEAR OR WHATEVER ANIMAL IS MOST IN KEEPING WITH THE PART AND CONFIDE IN THIS ANIMAL SUCH SORROWS HOPES OR SECRET HISTORY AS THE AUDIENCE HAS GOT TO KNOW
ENTER HAMLET WITH HIS FAVOURITE BOAR HOUND
LADY LARKSPUR STARTS SUDDENLY AND TURNS TOWARDS HIM
LARKSPUR BIT ME AGAIN THIS MORNING FOR THE THIRD TIME
I WANT TO GET AWAY FROM IT ALL SWOONS
ENTER LORD ARTHUR FLUFFINOSE
AND THERE YOU ARE YOU WILL OF COURSE APPRECIATE THAT THE UNFINISHED SENTENCES NOT ONLY SAVE TIME BUT ALSO MAKE THE MANOEUVRING VERY MUCH MORE NATURAL
HOW YOU MAY BE WONDERING ARE YOU TO BEGIN YOUR MASTERPIECE
RELAPSES INTO SILENCE FOR THE REST OF THE EVENING
THE DUCHESS OF SOUTHBRIDGE TO LORD REGGIE OH REGGIE WHAT DID YOU SAY
THEN LORD TUPPENY WELL WHAT ABOUT AUCTION
THE CROWD DRIFTS OFF LEAVING THE HERO AND HEROINE ALONE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE STAGE AND THEN YOU CAN BEGIN
THEN IS THE TIME TO INTRODUCE A MEAL ON THE STAGE
A STAGE MEAL IS POPULAR BECAUSE IT PROVES TO THE AUDIENCE THAT THE ACTORS EVEN WHEN CALLED CHARLES HAWTREY OR OWEN NARES ARE REAL PEOPLE JUST LIKE YOU AND ME
TEA PLEASE MATTHEWS BUTLER IMPASSIVELY
HOSTESS REPLACES LUMP AND INCLINES EMPTY TEAPOT OVER TRAY FOR A MOMENT THEN HANDS HIM A CUP PAINTED BROWN INSIDE THUS DECEIVING THE GENTLEMAN WITH THE TELESCOPE IN THE UPPER CIRCLE
RE ENTER BUTLER AND THREE FOOTMEN WHO REMOVE THE TEA THINGS HOSTESS TO GUEST
IN NOVELS THE HERO HAS OFTEN PUSHED HIS MEALS AWAY UNTASTED BUT NO STAGE HERO WOULD DO ANYTHING SO UNNATURAL AS THIS
TWO BITES ARE MADE AND THE BREAD IS CRUMBLED WITH AN AIR OF GREAT EAGERNESS INDEED ONE FEELS THAT IN REAL LIFE THE GUEST WOULD CLUTCH HOLD OF THE FOOTMAN AND SAY HALF A MO OLD CHAP I HAVEN'T NEARLY FINISHED BUT THE ACTOR IS BETTER SCHOOLED THAN THIS
BUT IT IS THE CIGARETTE WHICH CHIEFLY HAS BROUGHT THE MODERN DRAMA TO ITS PRESENT STATE OF PERFECTION
LORD JOHN TAKING OUT GOLD CIGARETTE CASE FROM HIS LEFT HAND UPPER WAISTCOAT POCKET
ALL ABOUT HIM WAS A TUMULT OF BRIGHT AND BROKEN COLOR SCATTERED IN BROAD SPLASHES
THE MERGANSER HAD A CRESTED HEAD OF IRIDESCENT GREEN BLACK A BROAD COLLAR OF LUSTROUS WHITE BLACK BACK BLACK AND WHITE WINGS WHITE BELLY SIDES FINELY PENCILLED IN BLACK AND WHITE AND A BREAST OF RICH CHESTNUT RED STREAKED WITH BLACK
HIS FEET WERE RED HIS LONG NARROW BEAK WITH ITS SAW TOOTHED EDGES AND SHARP HOOKED TIP WAS BRIGHT RED
BUT HERE HE WAS AT A TERRIBLE DISADVANTAGE AS COMPARED WITH THE OWLS HAWKS AND EAGLES HE HAD NO RENDING CLAWS
BUT SUDDENLY STRAIGHT AND SWIFT AS A DIVING CORMORANT HE SHOT DOWN INTO THE TORRENT AND DISAPPEARED BENEATH THE SURFACE
ONCE FAIRLY A WING HOWEVER HE WHEELED AND MADE BACK HURRIEDLY FOR HIS PERCH
IT MIGHT HAVE SEEMED THAT A TROUT OF THIS SIZE WAS A FAIRLY SUBSTANTIAL MEAL
BUT SUCH WAS HIS KEENNESS THAT EVEN WHILE THE WIDE FLUKES OF HIS ENGORGED VICTIM WERE STILL STICKING OUT AT THE CORNERS OF HIS BEAK HIS FIERCE RED EYES WERE ONCE MORE PEERING DOWNWARD INTO THE TORRENT IN SEARCH OF FRESH PREY
IN DESPAIR HE HURLED HIMSELF DOWNWARD TOO SOON
THE GREAT HAWK FOLLOWED HURRIEDLY TO RETRIEVE HIS PREY FROM THE GROUND
THE CAT GROWLED SOFTLY PICKED UP THE PRIZE IN HER JAWS AND TROTTED INTO THE BUSHES TO DEVOUR IT
IN FACT HE HAD JUST FINISHED IT THE LAST OF THE TROUT'S TAIL HAD JUST VANISHED WITH A SPASM DOWN HIS STRAINED GULLET WHEN THE BAFFLED HAWK CAUGHT SIGHT OF HIM AND SWOOPED
THE HAWK ALIGHTED ON THE DEAD BRANCH AND SAT UPRIGHT MOTIONLESS AS IF SURPRISED
LIKE HIS UNFORTUNATE LITTLE COUSIN THE TEAL HE TOO HAD FELT THE FEAR OF DEATH SMITTEN INTO HIS HEART AND WAS HEADING DESPERATELY FOR THE REFUGE OF SOME DARK OVERHANGING BANK DEEP FRINGED WITH WEEDS WHERE THE DREADFUL EYE OF THE HAWK SHOULD NOT DISCERN HIM
THE HAWK SAT UPON THE BRANCH AND WATCHED HIS QUARRY SWIMMING BENEATH THE SURFACE
ALMOST INSTANTLY HE WAS FORCED TO THE TOP
STRAIGHTWAY THE HAWK GLIDED FROM HIS PERCH AND DARTED AFTER HIM
BUT AT THIS POINT IN THE RAPIDS IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM TO STAY DOWN
BUT THIS FREQUENTER OF THE HEIGHTS OF AIR FOR ALL HIS SAVAGE VALOR WAS TROUBLED AT THE LEAPING WAVES AND THE TOSSING FOAM OF THESE MAD RAPIDS HE DID NOT UNDERSTAND THEM
AS HE FLEW HIS DOWN REACHING CLUTCHING TALONS WERE NOT HALF A YARD ABOVE THE FUGITIVE'S HEAD
WHERE THE WAVES FOR AN INSTANT SANK THEY CAME CLOSER BUT NOT QUITE WITHIN GRASPING REACH
BUT AS BEFORE THE LEAPING WAVES OF THE RAPIDS WERE TOO MUCH FOR HIS PURSUER AND HE WAS ABLE TO FLAP HIS WAY ONWARD IN A CLOUD OF FOAM WHILE DOOM HUNG LOW ABOVE HIS HEAD YET HESITATED TO STRIKE
THE HAWK EMBITTERED BY THE LOSS OF HIS FIRST QUARRY HAD BECOME AS DOGGED IN PURSUIT AS A WEASEL NOT TO BE SHAKEN OFF OR EVADED OR DECEIVED
HE HAD A LOT OF LINE OUT AND THE PLACE WAS NONE TOO FREE FOR A LONG CAST BUT HE WAS IMPATIENT TO DROP HIS FLIES AGAIN ON THE SPOT WHERE THE BIG FISH WAS FEEDING
THE LAST DROP FLY AS LUCK WOULD HAVE IT CAUGHT JUST IN THE CORNER OF THE HAWK'S ANGRILY OPEN BEAK HOOKING ITSELF FIRMLY
AT THE SUDDEN SHARP STING OF IT THE GREAT BIRD TURNED HIS HEAD AND NOTICED FOR THE FIRST TIME THE FISHERMAN STANDING ON THE BANK
THE DRAG UPON HIS BEAK AND THE LIGHT CHECK UPON HIS WINGS WERE INEXPLICABLE TO HIM AND APPALLING
THEN THE LEADER PARTED FROM THE LINE
THE HON CHARLES SMITH MISS SARAH'S BROTHER WAS WALKING SWIFTLY UPTOWN FROM MISTER EASTERLY'S WALL STREET OFFICE AND HIS FACE WAS PALE
AT LAST THE COTTON COMBINE WAS TO ALL APPEARANCES AN ASSURED FACT AND HE WAS SLATED FOR THE SENATE
WHY SHOULD HE NOT BE AS OTHER MEN
SHE WAS NOT HERSELF A NOTABLY INTELLIGENT WOMAN SHE GREATLY ADMIRED INTELLIGENCE OR WHATEVER LOOKED TO HER LIKE INTELLIGENCE IN OTHERS
AS SHE AWAITED HER GUESTS SHE SURVEYED THE TABLE WITH BOTH SATISFACTION AND DISQUIETUDE FOR HER SOCIAL FUNCTIONS WERE FEW TONIGHT THERE WERE SHE CHECKED THEM OFF ON HER FINGERS SIR JAMES CREIGHTON THE RICH ENGLISH MANUFACTURER AND LADY CREIGHTON MISTER AND MISSUS VANDERPOOL MISTER HARRY CRESSWELL AND HIS SISTER JOHN TAYLOR AND HIS SISTER AND MISTER CHARLES SMITH WHOM THE EVENING PAPERS MENTIONED AS LIKELY TO BE UNITED STATES SENATOR FROM NEW JERSEY A SELECTION OF GUESTS THAT HAD BEEN DETERMINED UNKNOWN TO THE HOSTESS BY THE MEETING OF COTTON INTERESTS EARLIER IN THE DAY
MISSUS GREY HAD MET SOUTHERNERS BEFORE BUT NOT INTIMATELY AND SHE ALWAYS HAD IN MIND VIVIDLY THEIR CRUELTY TO POOR NEGROES A SUBJECT SHE MADE A POINT OF INTRODUCING FORTHWITH
SHE WAS THEREFORE MOST AGREEABLY SURPRISED TO HEAR MISTER CRESSWELL EXPRESS HIMSELF SO CORDIALLY AS APPROVING OF NEGRO EDUCATION
BUT YOU BELIEVE IN SOME EDUCATION ASKED MARY TAYLOR
I BELIEVE IN THE TRAINING OF PEOPLE TO THEIR HIGHEST CAPACITY THE ENGLISHMAN HERE HEARTILY SECONDED HIM
BUT CRESSWELL ADDED SIGNIFICANTLY CAPACITY DIFFERS ENORMOUSLY BETWEEN RACES
THE VANDERPOOLS WERE SURE OF THIS AND THE ENGLISHMAN INSTANCING INDIA BECAME QUITE ELOQUENT MISSUS GREY WAS MYSTIFIED BUT HARDLY DARED ADMIT IT THE GENERAL TREND OF THE CONVERSATION SEEMED TO BE THAT MOST INDIVIDUALS NEEDED TO BE SUBMITTED TO THE SHARPEST SCRUTINY BEFORE BEING ALLOWED MUCH EDUCATION AND AS FOR THE LOWER RACES IT WAS SIMPLY CRIMINAL TO OPEN SUCH USELESS OPPORTUNITIES TO THEM
POSITIVELY HEROIC ADDED CRESSWELL AVOIDING HIS SISTER'S EYES
BUT WE'RE NOT ER EXACTLY WELCOMED
MARY TAYLOR HOWEVER RELATED THE TALE OF ZORA TO MISSUS GREY'S PRIVATE EAR LATER
FORTUNATELY SAID MISTER VANDERPOOL NORTHERNERS AND SOUTHERNERS ARE ARRIVING AT A BETTER MUTUAL UNDERSTANDING ON MOST OF THESE MATTERS
IN THE DEBATE BETWEEN THE SENIOR SOCIETIES HER DEFENCE OF THE FIFTEENTH AMENDMENT HAD BEEN NOT ONLY A NOTABLE BIT OF REASONING BUT DELIVERED WITH REAL ENTHUSIASM
THE SOUTH SHE HAD NOT THOUGHT OF SERIOUSLY AND YET KNOWING OF ITS DELIGHTFUL HOSPITALITY AND MILD CLIMATE SHE WAS NOT AVERSE TO CHARLESTON OR NEW ORLEANS
JOHN TAYLOR WHO HAD SUPPORTED HER THROUGH COLLEGE WAS INTERESTED IN COTTON
BETTER GO HE HAD COUNSELLED SENTENTIOUSLY
MIGHT LEARN SOMETHING USEFUL DOWN THERE
BUT JOHN THERE'S NO SOCIETY JUST ELEMENTARY WORK
BEEN LOOKING UP TOOMS COUNTY
FIND SOME CRESSWELLS THERE BIG PLANTATIONS RATED AT TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS
SOME OTHERS TOO BIG COTTON COUNTY
YOU OUGHT TO KNOW JOHN IF I TEACH NEGROES I'LL SCARCELY SEE MUCH OF PEOPLE IN MY OWN CLASS
AT ANY RATE I SAY GO
HERE SHE WAS TEACHING DIRTY CHILDREN AND THE SMELL OF CONFUSED ODORS AND BODILY PERSPIRATION WAS TO HER AT TIMES UNBEARABLE
SHE WANTED A GLANCE OF THE NEW BOOKS AND PERIODICALS AND TALK OF GREAT PHILANTHROPIES AND REFORMS
SO FOR THE HUNDREDTH TIME SHE WAS THINKING TODAY AS SHE WALKED ALONE UP THE LANE BACK OF THE BARN AND THEN SLOWLY DOWN THROUGH THE BOTTOMS
COTTON SHE PAUSED
SHE HAD ALMOST FORGOTTEN THAT IT WAS HERE WITHIN TOUCH AND SIGHT
THE GLIMMERING SEA OF DELICATE LEAVES WHISPERED AND MURMURED BEFORE HER STRETCHING AWAY TO THE NORTHWARD
THERE MIGHT BE A BIT OF POETRY HERE AND THERE BUT MOST OF THIS PLACE WAS SUCH DESPERATE PROSE
HER REGARD SHIFTED TO THE GREEN STALKS AND LEAVES AGAIN AND SHE STARTED TO MOVE AWAY
COTTON IS A WONDERFUL THING IS IT NOT BOYS SHE SAID RATHER PRIMLY
MISS TAYLOR DID NOT KNOW MUCH ABOUT COTTON BUT AT LEAST ONE MORE REMARK SEEMED CALLED FOR
DON'T KNOW WELL OF ALL THINGS INWARDLY COMMENTED MISS TAYLOR LITERALLY BORN IN COTTON AND OH WELL AS MUCH AS TO ASK WHAT'S THE USE SHE TURNED AGAIN TO GO
I SUPPOSE THOUGH IT'S TOO EARLY FOR THEM THEN CAME THE EXPLOSION
GOOBERS DON'T GROW ON THE TOPS OF VINES BUT UNDERGROUND ON THE ROOTS LIKE YAMS IS THAT SO
THE GOLDEN FLEECE IT'S THE SILVER FLEECE HE HARKENED
SOME TIME YOU'LL TELL ME PLEASE WON'T YOU
NOW FOR ONE LITTLE HALF HOUR SHE HAD BEEN A WOMAN TALKING TO A BOY NO NOT EVEN THAT SHE HAD BEEN TALKING JUST TALKING THERE WERE NO PERSONS IN THE CONVERSATION JUST THINGS ONE THING COTTON
HE KNEW THE SILVER FLEECE HIS AND ZORA'S MUST BE RUINED
IT WAS THE FIRST GREAT SORROW OF HIS LIFE IT WAS NOT SO MUCH THE LOSS OF THE COTTON ITSELF BUT THE FANTASY THE HOPES THE DREAMS BUILT AROUND IT
AH THE SWAMP THE CRUEL SWAMP
THE REVELATION OF HIS LOVE LIGHTED AND BRIGHTENED SLOWLY TILL IT FLAMED LIKE A SUNRISE OVER HIM AND LEFT HIM IN BURNING WONDER
HE PANTED TO KNOW IF SHE TOO KNEW OR KNEW AND CARED NOT OR CARED AND KNEW NOT
SHE WAS SO STRANGE AND HUMAN A CREATURE
THE WORLD WAS WATER VEILED IN MISTS
THEN OF A SUDDEN AT MIDDAY THE SUN SHOT OUT HOT AND STILL NO BREATH OF AIR STIRRED THE SKY WAS LIKE BLUE STEEL THE EARTH STEAMED
WHERE WAS THE USE OF IMAGINING
THE LAGOON HAD BEEN LEVEL WITH THE DYKES A WEEK AGO AND NOW
PERHAPS SHE TOO MIGHT BE THERE WAITING WEEPING
HE STARTED AT THE THOUGHT HE HURRIED FORTH SADLY
HE SPLASHED AND STAMPED ALONG FARTHER AND FARTHER ONWARD UNTIL HE NEARED THE RAMPART OF THE CLEARING AND PUT FOOT UPON THE TREE BRIDGE
THEN HE LOOKED DOWN THE LAGOON WAS DRY
HE STOOD A MOMENT BEWILDERED THEN TURNED AND RUSHED UPON THE ISLAND A GREAT SHEET OF DAZZLING SUNLIGHT SWEPT THE PLACE AND BENEATH LAY A MIGHTY MASS OF OLIVE GREEN THICK TALL WET AND WILLOWY
THE SQUARES OF COTTON SHARP EDGED HEAVY WERE JUST ABOUT TO BURST TO BOLLS
FOR ONE LONG MOMENT HE PAUSED STUPID AGAPE WITH UTTER AMAZEMENT THEN LEANED DIZZILY AGAINST A TREE
HE GAZED ABOUT PERPLEXED ASTONISHED
HERE LAY THE READING OF THE RIDDLE WITH INFINITE WORK AND PAIN SOME ONE HAD DUG A CANAL FROM THE LAGOON TO THE CREEK INTO WHICH THE FORMER HAD DRAINED BY A LONG AND CROOKED WAY THUS ALLOWING IT TO EMPTY DIRECTLY
HE SAT DOWN WEAK BEWILDERED AND ONE THOUGHT WAS UPPERMOST ZORA
THE YEARS OF THE DAYS OF HER DYING WERE TEN
THE HOPE AND DREAM OF HARVEST WAS UPON THE LAND
UP IN THE SICK ROOM ZORA LAY ON THE LITTLE WHITE BED
THE NET AND WEB OF ENDLESS THINGS HAD BEEN CRAWLING AND CREEPING AROUND HER SHE HAD STRUGGLED IN DUMB SPEECHLESS TERROR AGAINST SOME MIGHTY GRASPING THAT STROVE FOR HER LIFE WITH GNARLED AND CREEPING FINGERS BUT NOW AT LAST WEAKLY SHE OPENED HER EYES AND QUESTIONED
FOR A WHILE SHE LAY IN HER CHAIR IN HAPPY DREAMY PLEASURE AT SUN AND BIRD AND TREE
SHE ROSE WITH A FLEETING GLANCE GATHERED THE SHAWL ROUND HER THEN GLIDING FORWARD WAVERING TREMULOUS SLIPPED ACROSS THE ROAD AND INTO THE SWAMP
SHE HAD BEEN BORN WITHIN ITS BORDERS WITHIN ITS BORDERS SHE HAD LIVED AND GROWN AND WITHIN ITS BORDERS SHE HAD MET HER LOVE
ON SHE HURRIED UNTIL SWEEPING DOWN TO THE LAGOON AND THE ISLAND LO THE COTTON LAY BEFORE HER
THE CHAIR WAS EMPTY BUT HE KNEW
HE DARTED THROUGH THE TREES AND PAUSED A TALL MAN STRONGLY BUT SLIMLY MADE
OJO EXAMINED THIS CURIOUS CONTRIVANCE WITH WONDER
MARGOLOTTE HAD FIRST MADE THE GIRL'S FORM FROM THE PATCHWORK QUILT AND THEN SHE HAD DRESSED IT WITH A PATCHWORK SKIRT AND AN APRON WITH POCKETS IN IT USING THE SAME GAY MATERIAL THROUGHOUT
THE HEAD OF THE PATCHWORK GIRL WAS THE MOST CURIOUS PART OF HER
THE HAIR WAS OF BROWN YARN AND HUNG DOWN ON HER NECK IN SEVERAL NEAT BRAIDS
GOLD IS THE MOST COMMON METAL IN THE LAND OF OZ AND IS USED FOR MANY PURPOSES BECAUSE IT IS SOFT AND PLIABLE
NO I FORGOT ALL ABOUT THE BRAINS EXCLAIMED THE WOMAN
WELL THAT MAY BE TRUE AGREED MARGOLOTTE BUT ON THE CONTRARY A SERVANT WITH TOO MUCH BRAINS IS SURE TO BECOME INDEPENDENT AND HIGH AND MIGHTY AND FEEL ABOVE HER WORK
SHE POURED INTO THE DISH A QUANTITY FROM EACH OF THESE BOTTLES
I THINK THAT WILL DO SHE CONTINUED FOR THE OTHER QUALITIES ARE NOT NEEDED IN A SERVANT
SHE RAN TO HER HUSBAND'S SIDE AT ONCE AND HELPED HIM LIFT THE FOUR KETTLES FROM THE FIRE
THEIR CONTENTS HAD ALL BOILED AWAY LEAVING IN THE BOTTOM OF EACH KETTLE A FEW GRAINS OF FINE WHITE POWDER
VERY CAREFULLY THE MAGICIAN REMOVED THIS POWDER PLACING IT ALL TOGETHER IN A GOLDEN DISH WHERE HE MIXED IT WITH A GOLDEN SPOON
NO ONE SAW HIM DO THIS FOR ALL WERE LOOKING AT THE POWDER OF LIFE BUT SOON THE WOMAN REMEMBERED WHAT SHE HAD BEEN DOING AND CAME BACK TO THE CUPBOARD
OJO BECAME A BIT UNEASY AT THIS FOR HE HAD ALREADY PUT QUITE A LOT OF THE CLEVERNESS POWDER IN THE DISH BUT HE DARED NOT INTERFERE AND SO HE COMFORTED HIMSELF WITH THE THOUGHT THAT ONE CANNOT HAVE TOO MUCH CLEVERNESS
HE SELECTED A SMALL GOLD BOTTLE WITH A PEPPER BOX TOP SO THAT THE POWDER MIGHT BE SPRINKLED ON ANY OBJECT THROUGH THE SMALL HOLES
MOST PEOPLE TALK TOO MUCH SO IT IS A RELIEF TO FIND ONE WHO TALKS TOO LITTLE
I AM NOT ALLOWED TO PERFORM MAGIC EXCEPT FOR MY OWN AMUSEMENT HE TOLD HIS VISITORS AS HE LIGHTED A PIPE WITH A CROOKED STEM AND BEGAN TO SMOKE
THE WIZARD OF OZ WHO USED TO BE A HUMBUG AND KNEW NO MAGIC AT ALL HAS BEEN TAKING LESSONS OF GLINDA AND I'M TOLD HE IS GETTING TO BE A PRETTY GOOD WIZARD BUT HE IS MERELY THE ASSISTANT OF THE GREAT SORCERESS
IT TRULY IS ASSERTED THE MAGICIAN
I NOW USE THEM AS ORNAMENTAL STATUARY IN MY GARDEN
DEAR ME WHAT A CHATTERBOX YOU'RE GETTING TO BE UNC REMARKED THE MAGICIAN WHO WAS PLEASED WITH THE COMPLIMENT
ASKED THE VOICE IN SCORNFUL ACCENTS
HE WORE BLUE SILK STOCKINGS BLUE KNEE PANTS WITH GOLD BUCKLES A BLUE RUFFLED WAIST AND A JACKET OF BRIGHT BLUE BRAIDED WITH GOLD
HIS HAT HAD A PEAKED CROWN AND A FLAT BRIM AND AROUND THE BRIM WAS A ROW OF TINY GOLDEN BELLS THAT TINKLED WHEN HE MOVED
INSTEAD OF SHOES THE OLD MAN WORE BOOTS WITH TURNOVER TOPS AND HIS BLUE COAT HAD WIDE CUFFS OF GOLD BRAID
FOR A LONG TIME HE HAD WISHED TO EXPLORE THE BEAUTIFUL LAND OF OZ IN WHICH THEY LIVED
WHEN THEY WERE OUTSIDE UNC SIMPLY LATCHED THE DOOR AND STARTED UP THE PATH
NO ONE WOULD DISTURB THEIR LITTLE HOUSE EVEN IF ANYONE CAME SO FAR INTO THE THICK FOREST WHILE THEY WERE GONE
AT THE FOOT OF THE MOUNTAIN THAT SEPARATED THE COUNTRY OF THE MUNCHKINS FROM THE COUNTRY OF THE GILLIKINS THE PATH DIVIDED
HE KNEW IT WOULD TAKE THEM TO THE HOUSE OF THE CROOKED MAGICIAN WHOM HE HAD NEVER SEEN BUT WHO WAS THEIR NEAREST NEIGHBOR
ALL THE MORNING THEY TRUDGED UP THE MOUNTAIN PATH AND AT NOON UNC AND OJO SAT ON A FALLEN TREE TRUNK AND ATE THE LAST OF THE BREAD WHICH THE OLD MUNCHKIN HAD PLACED IN HIS POCKET
THEN THEY STARTED ON AGAIN AND TWO HOURS LATER CAME IN SIGHT OF THE HOUSE OF DOCTOR PIPT
UNC KNOCKED AT THE DOOR OF THE HOUSE AND A CHUBBY PLEASANT FACED WOMAN DRESSED ALL IN BLUE OPENED IT AND GREETED THE VISITORS WITH A SMILE
I AM MY DEAR AND ALL STRANGERS ARE WELCOME TO MY HOME
WE HAVE COME FROM A FAR LONELIER PLACE THAN THIS A LONELIER PLACE
AND YOU MUST BE OJO THE UNLUCKY SHE ADDED
OJO HAD NEVER EATEN SUCH A FINE MEAL IN ALL HIS LIFE
WE ARE TRAVELING REPLIED OJO AND WE STOPPED AT YOUR HOUSE JUST TO REST AND REFRESH OURSELVES
THE WOMAN SEEMED THOUGHTFUL
AT ONE END STOOD A GREAT FIREPLACE IN WHICH A BLUE LOG WAS BLAZING WITH A BLUE FLAME AND OVER THE FIRE HUNG FOUR KETTLES IN A ROW ALL BUBBLING AND STEAMING AT A GREAT RATE
IT TAKES ME SEVERAL YEARS TO MAKE THIS MAGIC POWDER BUT AT THIS MOMENT I AM PLEASED TO SAY IT IS NEARLY DONE YOU SEE I AM MAKING IT FOR MY GOOD WIFE MARGOLOTTE WHO WANTS TO USE SOME OF IT FOR A PURPOSE OF HER OWN
YOU MUST KNOW SAID MARGOLOTTE WHEN THEY WERE ALL SEATED TOGETHER ON THE BROAD WINDOW SEAT THAT MY HUSBAND FOOLISHLY GAVE AWAY ALL THE POWDER OF LIFE HE FIRST MADE TO OLD MOMBI THE WITCH WHO USED TO LIVE IN THE COUNTRY OF THE GILLIKINS TO THE NORTH OF HERE
THE FIRST LOT WE TESTED ON OUR GLASS CAT WHICH NOT ONLY BEGAN TO LIVE BUT HAS LIVED EVER SINCE
I THINK THE NEXT GLASS CAT THE MAGICIAN MAKES WILL HAVE NEITHER BRAINS NOR HEART FOR THEN IT WILL NOT OBJECT TO CATCHING MICE AND MAY PROVE OF SOME USE TO US
I'M AFRAID I DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT THE LAND OF OZ
YOU SEE I'VE LIVED ALL MY LIFE WITH UNC NUNKIE THE SILENT ONE AND THERE WAS NO ONE TO TELL ME ANYTHING
THAT IS ONE REASON YOU ARE OJO THE UNLUCKY SAID THE WOMAN IN A SYMPATHETIC TONE
I THINK I MUST SHOW YOU MY PATCHWORK GIRL SAID MARGOLOTTE LAUGHING AT THE BOY'S ASTONISHMENT FOR SHE IS RATHER DIFFICULT TO EXPLAIN
BUT FIRST I WILL TELL YOU THAT FOR MANY YEARS I HAVE LONGED FOR A SERVANT TO HELP ME WITH THE HOUSEWORK AND TO COOK THE MEALS AND WASH THE DISHES
YET THAT TASK WAS NOT SO EASY AS YOU MAY SUPPOSE
A BED QUILT MADE OF PATCHES OF DIFFERENT KINDS AND COLORS OF CLOTH ALL NEATLY SEWED TOGETHER
SOMETIMES IT IS CALLED A CRAZY QUILT BECAUSE THE PATCHES AND COLORS ARE SO MIXED UP
WHEN I FOUND IT I SAID TO MYSELF THAT IT WOULD DO NICELY FOR MY SERVANT GIRL FOR WHEN SHE WAS BROUGHT TO LIFE SHE WOULD NOT BE PROUD NOR HAUGHTY AS THE GLASS CAT IS FOR SUCH A DREADFUL MIXTURE OF COLORS WOULD DISCOURAGE HER FROM TRYING TO BE AS DIGNIFIED AS THE BLUE MUNCHKINS ARE
AT THE EMERALD CITY WHERE OUR PRINCESS OZMA LIVES GREEN IS THE POPULAR COLOR
I WILL SHOW YOU WHAT A GOOD JOB I DID AND SHE WENT TO A TALL CUPBOARD AND THREW OPEN THE DOORS
THE GRATEFUL APPLAUSE OF THE CLERGY HAS CONSECRATED THE MEMORY OF A PRINCE WHO INDULGED THEIR PASSIONS AND PROMOTED THEIR INTEREST
THE EDICT OF MILAN THE GREAT CHARTER OF TOLERATION HAD CONFIRMED TO EACH INDIVIDUAL OF THE ROMAN WORLD THE PRIVILEGE OF CHOOSING AND PROFESSING HIS OWN RELIGION
BUT THIS INESTIMABLE PRIVILEGE WAS SOON VIOLATED WITH THE KNOWLEDGE OF TRUTH THE EMPEROR IMBIBED THE MAXIMS OF PERSECUTION AND THE SECTS WHICH DISSENTED FROM THE CATHOLIC CHURCH WERE AFFLICTED AND OPPRESSED BY THE TRIUMPH OF CHRISTIANITY
CONSTANTINE EASILY BELIEVED THAT THE HERETICS WHO PRESUMED TO DISPUTE HIS OPINIONS OR TO OPPOSE HIS COMMANDS WERE GUILTY OF THE MOST ABSURD AND CRIMINAL OBSTINACY AND THAT A SEASONABLE APPLICATION OF MODERATE SEVERITIES MIGHT SAVE THOSE UNHAPPY MEN FROM THE DANGER OF AN EVERLASTING CONDEMNATION
SOME OF THE PENAL REGULATIONS WERE COPIED FROM THE EDICTS OF DIOCLETIAN AND THIS METHOD OF CONVERSION WAS APPLAUDED BY THE SAME BISHOPS WHO HAD FELT THE HAND OF OPPRESSION AND PLEADED FOR THE RIGHTS OF HUMANITY
THEY ASSERTED WITH CONFIDENCE AND ALMOST WITH EXULTATION THAT THE APOSTOLICAL SUCCESSION WAS INTERRUPTED THAT ALL THE BISHOPS OF EUROPE AND ASIA WERE INFECTED BY THE CONTAGION OF GUILT AND SCHISM AND THAT THE PREROGATIVES OF THE CATHOLIC CHURCH WERE CONFINED TO THE CHOSEN PORTION OF THE AFRICAN BELIEVERS WHO ALONE HAD PRESERVED INVIOLATE THE INTEGRITY OF THEIR FAITH AND DISCIPLINE
BISHOPS VIRGINS AND EVEN SPOTLESS INFANTS WERE SUBJECTED TO THE DISGRACE OF A PUBLIC PENANCE BEFORE THEY COULD BE ADMITTED TO THE COMMUNION OF THE DONATISTS
PROSCRIBED BY THE CIVIL AND ECCLESIASTICAL POWERS OF THE EMPIRE THE DONATISTS STILL MAINTAINED IN SOME PROVINCES PARTICULARLY IN NUMIDIA THEIR SUPERIOR NUMBERS AND FOUR HUNDRED BISHOPS ACKNOWLEDGED THE JURISDICTION OF THEIR PRIMATE
IT WAS ONE OF THE MASTERLY AND CHARMING STORIES OF DUMAS THE ELDER
IN FIVE MINUTES I WAS IN A NEW WORLD AND MY MELANCHOLY ROOM WAS FULL OF THE LIVELIEST FRENCH COMPANY
THE SOUND OF AN IMPERATIVE AND UNCOMPROMISING BELL RECALLED ME IN DUE TIME TO THE REGIONS OF REALITY
AMBROSE MET ME AT THE BOTTOM OF THE STAIRS AND SHOWED ME THE WAY TO THE SUPPER ROOM
SHE SIGNED TO ME WITH A GHOSTLY SOLEMNITY TO TAKE THE VACANT PLACE ON THE LEFT OF HER FATHER
THE DOOR OPENED AGAIN WHILE I WAS STILL STUDYING THE TWO BROTHERS WITHOUT I HONESTLY CONFESS BEING VERY FAVORABLY IMPRESSED BY EITHER OF THEM
A NEW MEMBER OF THE FAMILY CIRCLE WHO INSTANTLY ATTRACTED MY ATTENTION ENTERED THE ROOM
A LITTLE CRACKED THAT IN THE POPULAR PHRASE WAS MY IMPRESSION OF THE STRANGER WHO NOW MADE HIS APPEARANCE IN THE SUPPER ROOM
MISTER MEADOWCROFT THE ELDER HAVING NOT SPOKEN ONE WORD THUS FAR HIMSELF INTRODUCED THE NEWCOMER TO ME WITH A SIDE GLANCE AT HIS SONS WHICH HAD SOMETHING LIKE DEFIANCE IN IT A GLANCE WHICH AS I WAS SORRY TO NOTICE WAS RETURNED WITH THE DEFIANCE ON THEIR SIDE BY THE TWO YOUNG MEN
PHILIP LEFRANK THIS IS MY OVERLOOKER MISTER JAGO SAID THE OLD MAN FORMALLY PRESENTING US
HE IS NOT WELL HE HAS COME OVER THE OCEAN FOR REST AND CHANGE OF SCENE
MISTER JAGO IS AN AMERICAN PHILIP
MAKE ACQUAINTANCE WITH MISTER JAGO SIT TOGETHER
THEY POINTEDLY DREW BACK FROM JOHN JAGO AS HE APPROACHED THE EMPTY CHAIR NEXT TO ME AND MOVED ROUND TO THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE TABLE
A PRETTY GIRL AND SO FAR AS I COULD JUDGE BY APPEARANCES A GOOD GIRL TOO DESCRIBING HER GENERALLY I MAY SAY THAT SHE HAD A SMALL HEAD WELL CARRIED AND WELL SET ON HER SHOULDERS BRIGHT GRAY EYES THAT LOOKED AT YOU HONESTLY AND MEANT WHAT THEY LOOKED A TRIM SLIGHT LITTLE FIGURE TOO SLIGHT FOR OUR ENGLISH NOTIONS OF BEAUTY A STRONG AMERICAN ACCENT AND A RARE THING IN AMERICA A PLEASANTLY TONED VOICE WHICH MADE THE ACCENT AGREEABLE TO ENGLISH EARS
OUR FIRST IMPRESSIONS OF PEOPLE ARE IN NINE CASES OUT OF TEN THE RIGHT IMPRESSIONS
FOR ONCE IN A WAY I PROVED A TRUE PROPHET
THE ONLY CHEERFUL CONVERSATION WAS THE CONVERSATION ACROSS THE TABLE BETWEEN NAOMI AND ME
HE LOOKED UP AT NAOMI DOUBTINGLY FROM HIS PLATE AND LOOKED DOWN AGAIN SLOWLY WITH A FROWN
WHEN I ADDRESSED HIM HE ANSWERED CONSTRAINEDLY
A MORE DREARY AND MORE DISUNITED FAMILY PARTY I NEVER SAT AT THE TABLE WITH
ENVY HATRED MALICE AND UNCHARITABLENESS ARE NEVER SO ESSENTIALLY DETESTABLE TO MY MIND AS WHEN THEY ARE ANIMATED BY A SENSE OF PROPRIETY AND WORK UNDER THE SURFACE BUT FOR MY INTEREST IN NAOMI AND MY OTHER INTEREST IN THE LITTLE LOVE LOOKS WHICH I NOW AND THEN SURPRISED PASSING BETWEEN HER AND AMBROSE I SHOULD NEVER HAVE SAT THROUGH THAT SUPPER
I WISH YOU GOOD NIGHT SHE LAID HER BONY HANDS ON THE BACK OF MISTER MEADOWCROFT'S INVALID CHAIR CUT HIM SHORT IN HIS FAREWELL SALUTATION TO ME AND WHEELED HIM OUT TO HIS BED AS IF SHE WERE WHEELING HIM OUT TO HIS GRAVE
YOU WERE QUITE RIGHT TO SAY NO AMBROSE BEGAN NEVER SMOKE WITH JOHN JAGO HIS CIGARS WILL POISON YOU
NAOMI SHOOK HER FOREFINGER REPROACHFULLY AT THEM AS IF THE TWO STURDY YOUNG FARMERS HAD BEEN TWO CHILDREN
SILAS SLUNK AWAY WITHOUT A WORD OF PROTEST AMBROSE STOOD HIS GROUND EVIDENTLY BENT ON MAKING HIS PEACE WITH NAOMI BEFORE HE LEFT HER SEEING THAT I WAS IN THE WAY I WALKED ASIDE TOWARD A GLASS DOOR AT THE LOWER END OF THE ROOM
CHAPTER SEVEN ON THE RACES OF MAN
IN DETERMINING WHETHER TWO OR MORE ALLIED FORMS OUGHT TO BE RANKED AS SPECIES OR VARIETIES NATURALISTS ARE PRACTICALLY GUIDED BY THE FOLLOWING CONSIDERATIONS NAMELY THE AMOUNT OF DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THEM AND WHETHER SUCH DIFFERENCES RELATE TO FEW OR MANY POINTS OF STRUCTURE AND WHETHER THEY ARE OF PHYSIOLOGICAL IMPORTANCE BUT MORE ESPECIALLY WHETHER THEY ARE CONSTANT
AT ANOTHER TIME HARALD ASKED
WHAT IS YOUR COUNTRY OLAF HAVE YOU ALWAYS BEEN A THRALL THE THRALL'S EYES FLASHED
TWO HUNDRED WARRIORS FEASTED IN HIS HALL AND FOLLOWED HIM TO BATTLE
THE REST OF YOU OFF A VIKING HE HAD THREE SHIPS
THESE HE GAVE TO THREE OF MY BROTHERS
BUT I STAYED THAT SPRING AND BUILT ME A BOAT
I MADE HER FOR ONLY TWENTY OARS BECAUSE I THOUGHT FEW MEN WOULD FOLLOW ME FOR I WAS YOUNG FIFTEEN YEARS OLD
AT THE PROW I CARVED THE HEAD WITH OPEN MOUTH AND FORKED TONGUE THRUST OUT
I PAINTED THE EYES RED FOR ANGER
THERE STAND SO I SAID AND GLARE AND HISS AT MY FOES
IN THE STERN I CURVED THE TAIL UP ALMOST AS HIGH AS THE HEAD
THERE SHE SAT ON THE ROLLERS AS FAIR A SHIP AS I EVER SAW
THEN I WILL GET ME A FARM AND WILL WINTER IN THAT LAND NOW WHO WILL FOLLOW ME
HE IS BUT A BOY THE MEN SAID
THIRTY MEN ONE AFTER ANOTHER RAISED THEIR HORNS AND SAID
AS OUR BOAT FLASHED DOWN THE ROLLERS INTO THE WATER I MADE THIS SONG AND SANG IT
SO WE HARRIED THE COAST OF NORWAY
WE ATE AT MANY MEN'S TABLES UNINVITED
MY DRAGON'S BELLY IS NEVER FULL AND ON BOARD WENT THE GOLD
OH IT IS BETTER TO LIVE ON THE SEA AND LET OTHER MEN RAISE YOUR CROPS AND COOK YOUR MEALS
A HOUSE SMELLS OF SMOKE A SHIP SMELLS OF FROLIC
UP AND DOWN THE WATER WE WENT TO GET MUCH WEALTH AND MUCH FROLIC
WHAT OF THE FARM OLAF NOT YET I ANSWERED VIKING IS BETTER FOR SUMMER
IT WAS SO DARK THAT I COULD SEE NOTHING BUT A FEW SPARKS ON THE HEARTH
I STOOD WITH MY BACK TO THE WALL FOR I WANTED NO SWORD REACHING OUT OF THE DARK FOR ME
COME COME I CALLED WHEN NO ONE OBEYED A FIRE
MY MEN LAUGHED YES A STINGY HOST
HE ACTS AS THOUGH HE HAD NOT EXPECTED US
ON A BENCH IN A FAR CORNER WERE A DOZEN PEOPLE HUDDLED TOGETHER
BRING IN THE TABLE WE ARE HUNGRY
THE THRALLS WERE BRINGING IN A GREAT POT OF MEAT
THEY SET UP A CRANE OVER THE FIRE AND HUNG THE POT UPON IT AND WE SAT AND WATCHED IT BOIL WHILE WE JOKED AT LAST THE SUPPER BEGAN
THE FARMER SAT GLOOMILY ON THE BENCH AND WOULD NOT EAT AND YOU CANNOT WONDER FOR HE SAW US PUTTING POTFULS OF HIS GOOD BEEF AND BASKET LOADS OF BREAD INTO OUR BIG MOUTHS
YOU WOULD NOT EAT WITH US YOU CANNOT SAY NO TO HALF OF MY ALE I DRINK THIS TO YOUR HEALTH
THEN I DRANK HALF OF THE HORNFUL AND SENT THE REST ACROSS THE FIRE TO THE FARMER HE TOOK IT AND SMILED SAYING
DID YOU EVER HAVE SUCH A LORDLY GUEST BEFORE I WENT ON
SO I WILL GIVE OUT THIS LAW THAT MY MEN SHALL NEVER LEAVE YOU ALONE
HAKON THERE SHALL BE YOUR CONSTANT COMPANION FRIEND FARMER
HE SHALL NOT LEAVE YOU DAY OR NIGHT WHETHER YOU ARE WORKING OR PLAYING OR SLEEPING
I NAMED NINE OTHERS AND SAID
AND THESE SHALL FOLLOW YOUR THRALLS IN THE SAME WAY
SO I SET GUARDS OVER EVERY ONE IN THAT HOUSE
SO NO TALES GOT OUT TO THE NEIGHBORS BESIDES IT WAS A LONELY PLACE AND BY GOOD LUCK NO ONE CAME THAT WAY
THEIR EYES DANCED BIG THORLEIF STOOD UP AND STRETCHED HIMSELF
I AM STIFF WITH LONG SITTING HE SAID I ITCH FOR A FIGHT I TURNED TO THE FARMER
THIS IS OUR LAST FEAST WITH YOU I SAID
BY THE BEARD OF ODIN I CRIED YOU HAVE TAKEN OUR JOKE LIKE A MAN
MY MEN POUNDED THE TABLE WITH THEIR FISTS
BY THE HAMMER OF THOR SHOUTED GRIM HERE IS NO STINGY COWARD
HERE FRIEND TAKE IT AND HE THRUST IT INTO THE FARMER'S HAND
MAY YOU DRINK HEART'S EASE FROM IT FOR MANY YEARS
AND WITH IT I LEAVE YOU A NAME SIF THE FRIENDLY I SHALL HOPE TO DRINK WITH YOU SOMETIME IN VALHALLA
HERE IS A RING FOR SIF THE FRIENDLY AND HERE IS A BRACELET A SWORD WOULD NOT BE ASHAMED TO HANG AT YOUR SIDE
I TOOK FIVE GREAT BRACELETS OF GOLD FROM OUR TREASURE CHEST AND GAVE THEM TO HIM
THAT IS THE BEST WAY TO DECIDE FOR THE SPEAR WILL ALWAYS POINT SOMEWHERE AND ONE THING IS AS GOOD AS ANOTHER
THAT TIME IT POINTED US INTO YOUR FATHER'S SHIPS
HERE THEY SAID IS A RASCAL WHO HAS BEEN HARRYING OUR COASTS
WE SUNK HIS SHIP AND MEN BUT HIM WE BROUGHT TO YOU
A ROBBER VIKING SAID THE KING AND SCOWLED AT ME
YES AND WITH ALL YOUR FINGERS IT TOOK YOU A YEAR TO CATCH ME THE KING FROWNED MORE ANGRILY
TAKE HIM OUT THORKEL AND LET HIM TASTE YOUR SWORD
YOUR MOTHER THE QUEEN WAS STANDING BY
NOW SHE PUT HER HAND ON HIS ARM AND SMILED AND SAID
AND WOULD HE NOT BE A GOOD GIFT FOR OUR BABY
YOUR FATHER THOUGHT A MOMENT THEN LOOKED AT YOUR MOTHER AND SMILED
SOFT HEART HE SAID GENTLY TO HER THEN TO THORKEL WELL LET HIM GO THORKEL
THEN HE TURNED TO ME AGAIN FROWNING
BUT YOUNG SHARP TONGUE NOW THAT WE HAVE CAUGHT YOU WE WILL PUT YOU INTO A TRAP THAT YOU CANNOT GET OUT OF
SO I LIVED AND NOW AM YOUR TOOTH THRALL WELL IT IS THE LUCK OF WAR
IT IS MANIFEST THAT MAN IS NOW SUBJECT TO MUCH VARIABILITY
SO IT IS WITH THE LOWER ANIMALS
THE VARIABILITY OF MULTIPLE PARTS
BUT THIS SUBJECT WILL BE MORE PROPERLY DISCUSSED WHEN WE TREAT OF THE DIFFERENT RACES OF MANKIND
EFFECTS OF THE INCREASED USE AND DISUSE OF PARTS
I REMAINED THERE ALONE FOR MANY HOURS BUT I MUST ACKNOWLEDGE THAT BEFORE I LEFT THE CHAMBERS I HAD GRADUALLY BROUGHT MYSELF TO LOOK AT THE MATTER IN ANOTHER LIGHT
HAD EVA CRASWELLER NOT BEEN GOOD LOOKING HAD JACK BEEN STILL AT COLLEGE HAD SIR KENNINGTON OVAL REMAINED IN ENGLAND HAD MISTER BUNNIT AND THE BAR KEEPER NOT SUCCEEDED IN STOPPING MY CARRIAGE ON THE HILL SHOULD I HAVE SUCCEEDED IN ARRANGING FOR THE FINAL DEPARTURE OF MY OLD FRIEND
ON ARRIVING AT HOME AT MY OWN RESIDENCE I FOUND THAT OUR SALON WAS FILLED WITH A BRILLIANT COMPANY
AS I SPOKE I MADE HIM A GRACIOUS BOW AND I THINK I SHOWED HIM BY MY MODE OF ADDRESS THAT I DID NOT BEAR ANY GRUDGE AS TO MY INDIVIDUAL SELF
I HAVE COME TO YOUR SHORES MISTER PRESIDENT WITH THE PURPOSE OF SEEING HOW THINGS ARE PROGRESSING IN THIS DISTANT QUARTER OF THE WORLD
WE HAVE OUR LITTLE STRUGGLES HERE AS ELSEWHERE AND ALL THINGS CANNOT BE DONE BY ROSE WATER
WE ARE QUITE SATISFIED NOW CAPTAIN BATTLEAX SAID MY WIFE
QUITE SATISFIED SAID EVA
THE LADIES IN COMPLIANCE WITH THAT SOFTNESS OF HEART WHICH IS THEIR CHARACTERISTIC ARE ON ONE SIDE AND THE MEN BY WHOM THE WORLD HAS TO BE MANAGED ARE ON THE OTHER
NO DOUBT IN PROCESS OF TIME THE LADIES WILL FOLLOW
THEIR MASTERS SAID MISSUS NEVERBEND
I DID NOT MEAN SAID CAPTAIN BATTLEAX TO TOUCH UPON PUBLIC SUBJECTS AT SUCH A MOMENT AS THIS
MISSUS NEVERBEND YOU MUST INDEED BE PROUD OF YOUR SON
JACK HAD BEEN STANDING IN THE FAR CORNER OF THE ROOM TALKING TO EVA AND WAS NOW REDUCED TO SILENCE BY HIS PRAISES
SIR KENNINGTON OVAL IS A VERY FINE PLAYER SAID MY WIFE
I AND MY WIFE AND SON AND THE TWO CRASWELLERS AND THREE OR FOUR OTHERS AGREED TO DINE ON BOARD THE SHIP ON THE NEXT
THIS I FELT WAS PAID TO ME AS BEING PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC AND I ENDEAVOURED TO BEHAVE MYSELF WITH SUCH MINGLED HUMILITY AND DIGNITY AS MIGHT BEFIT THE OCCASION BUT I COULD NOT BUT FEEL THAT SOMETHING WAS WANTING TO THE SIMPLICITY OF MY ORDINARY LIFE
MY WIFE ON THE SPUR OF THE MOMENT MANAGED TO GIVE THE GENTLEMEN A VERY GOOD DINNER
THIS SHE SAID WAS TRUE HOSPITALITY AND I AM NOT SURE THAT I DID NOT AGREE WITH HER
THEN THERE WERE THREE OR FOUR LEADING MEN OF THE COMMUNITY WITH THEIR WIVES WHO WERE FOR THE MOST PART THE FATHERS AND MOTHERS OF THE YOUNG LADIES
OH YES SAID JACK AND I'M NOWHERE
BUT I MEAN TO HAVE MY INNINGS BEFORE LONG
OF WHAT MISSUS NEVERBEND HAD GONE THROUGH IN PROVIDING BIRDS BEASTS AND FISHES NOT TO TALK OF TARTS AND JELLIES FOR THE DINNER OF THAT DAY NO ONE BUT MYSELF CAN HAVE ANY IDEA BUT IT MUST BE ADMITTED THAT SHE ACCOMPLISHED HER TASK WITH THOROUGH SUCCESS
WE SAT WITH THE OFFICERS SOME LITTLE TIME AFTER DINNER AND THEN WENT ASHORE
HOW MUCH OF EVIL OF REAL ACCOMPLISHED EVIL HAD THERE NOT OCCURRED TO ME DURING THE LAST FEW DAYS
WHAT COULD I DO NOW BUT JUST LAY MYSELF DOWN AND DIE
AND THE DEATH OF WHICH I DREAMT COULD NOT ALAS
WHEN THIS CAPTAIN SHOULD HAVE TAKEN HIMSELF AND HIS VESSEL BACK TO ENGLAND I WOULD RETIRE TO A SMALL FARM WHICH I POSSESSED AT THE FARTHEST SIDE OF THE ISLAND AND THERE IN SECLUSION WOULD I END MY DAYS
JACK WOULD BECOME EVA'S HAPPY HUSBAND AND WOULD REMAIN AMIDST THE HURRIED DUTIES OF THE EAGER WORLD
THINKING OF ALL THIS I WENT TO SLEEP
MISTER NEVERBEND BEGAN THE CAPTAIN AND I OBSERVED THAT UP TO THAT MOMENT HE HAD GENERALLY ADDRESSED ME AS PRESIDENT IT CANNOT BE DENIED THAT WE HAVE COME HERE ON AN UNPLEASANT MISSION
YOU HAVE RECEIVED US WITH ALL THAT COURTESY AND HOSPITALITY FOR WHICH YOUR CHARACTER IN ENGLAND STANDS SO HIGH
IT IS A DUTY SAID I
BUT YOUR POWER IS SO SUPERIOR TO ANY THAT I CAN ADVANCE AS TO MAKE US HERE FEEL THAT THERE IS NO DISGRACE IN YIELDING TO IT
NOT A DOUBT BUT HAD YOUR FORCE BEEN ONLY DOUBLE OR TREBLE OUR OWN I SHOULD HAVE FOUND IT MY DUTY TO STRUGGLE WITH YOU
THAT IS ALL QUITE TRUE MISTER NEVERBEND SAID SIR FERDINANDO BROWN
I CAN AFFORD TO SMILE BECAUSE I AM ABSOLUTELY POWERLESS BEFORE YOU BUT I DO NOT THE LESS FEEL THAT IN A MATTER IN WHICH THE PROGRESS OF THE WORLD IS CONCERNED I OR RATHER WE HAVE BEEN PUT DOWN BY BRUTE FORCE
YOU HAVE COME TO US THREATENING US WITH ABSOLUTE DESTRUCTION
THEREFORE I FEEL MYSELF QUITE ABLE AS PRESIDENT OF THIS REPUBLIC TO RECEIVE YOU WITH A COURTESY DUE TO THE SERVANTS OF A FRIENDLY ALLY
I CAN ASSURE YOU HE HAS NOT EVEN ALLOWED ME TO SEE THE TRIGGER SINCE I HAVE BEEN ON BOARD
THEN SAID SIR FERDINANDO THERE IS NOTHING FOR IT BUT THAT HE MUST TAKE YOU WITH HIM
THERE CAME UPON ME A SUDDEN SHOCK WHEN I HEARD THESE WORDS WHICH EXCEEDED ANYTHING WHICH I HAD YET FELT
YOU HEAR WHAT SIR FERDINANDO BROWN HAS SAID REPLIED CAPTAIN BATTLEAX
BUT WHAT IS THE DELICATE MISSION I ASKED
I WAS TO BE TAKEN AWAY AND CARRIED TO ENGLAND OR ELSEWHERE OR DROWNED UPON THE VOYAGE IT MATTERED NOT WHICH
THEN THE REPUBLIC OF BRITANNULA WAS TO BE DECLARED AS NON EXISTENT AND THE BRITISH FLAG WAS TO BE EXALTED AND A BRITISH GOVERNOR INSTALLED IN THE EXECUTIVE CHAMBERS
YOU MAY BE QUITE SURE IT'S THERE SAID CAPTAIN BATTLEAX AND THAT I CAN SO USE IT AS TO HALF OBLITERATE YOUR TOWN WITHIN TWO MINUTES OF MY RETURN ON BOARD
YOU PROPOSE TO KIDNAP ME I SAID
WHAT WOULD BECOME OF YOUR GUN WERE I TO KIDNAP YOU
LIEUTENANT CROSSTREES IS A VERY GALLANT OFFICER
ONE OF US ALWAYS REMAINS ON BOARD WHILE THE OTHER IS ON SHORE
WHAT WORLD WIDE INIQUITY SUCH A SPEECH AS THAT DISCLOSES SAID I STILL TURNING MYSELF TO THE CAPTAIN FOR THOUGH I WOULD HAVE CRUSHED THEM BOTH BY MY WORDS HAD IT BEEN POSSIBLE MY DISLIKE CENTRED ITSELF ON SIR FERDINANDO
YOU WILL ALLOW ME TO SUGGEST SAID HE THAT THAT IS A MATTER OF OPINION
WERE I TO COMPLY WITH YOUR ORDERS WITHOUT EXPRESSING MY OWN OPINION I SHOULD SEEM TO HAVE DONE SO WILLINGLY HEREAFTER
THE LETTER RAN AS FOLLOWS
SIR I HAVE IT IN COMMAND TO INFORM YOUR EXCELLENCY THAT YOU HAVE BEEN APPOINTED GOVERNOR OF THE CROWN COLONY WHICH IS CALLED BRITANNULA
THE PECULIAR CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE COLONY ARE WITHIN YOUR EXCELLENCY'S KNOWLEDGE
BUT IN THEIR SELECTION OF A CONSTITUTION THE BRITANNULISTS HAVE UNFORTUNATELY ALLOWED THEMSELVES BUT ONE DELIBERATIVE ASSEMBLY AND HENCE HAVE SPRUNG THEIR PRESENT DIFFICULTIES
IT IS FOUNDED ON THE ACKNOWLEDGED WEAKNESS OF THOSE WHO SURVIVE THAT PERIOD OF LIFE AT WHICH MEN CEASE TO WORK
BUT IT IS SURMISED THAT YOU WILL FIND DIFFICULTIES IN THE WAY OF YOUR ENTERING AT ONCE UPON YOUR GOVERNMENT
THE JOHN BRIGHT IS ARMED WITH A WEAPON OF GREAT POWER AGAINST WHICH IT IS IMPOSSIBLE THAT THE PEOPLE OF BRITANNULA SHOULD PREVAIL
YOU WILL CARRY OUT WITH YOU ONE HUNDRED MEN OF THE NORTH NORTH WEST BIRMINGHAM REGIMENT WHICH WILL PROBABLY SUFFICE FOR YOUR OWN SECURITY AS IT IS THOUGHT THAT IF MISTER NEVERBEND BE WITHDRAWN THE PEOPLE WILL REVERT EASILY TO THEIR OLD HABITS OF OBEDIENCE
WHEN DO YOU INTEND THAT THE JOHN BRIGHT SHALL START
TO DAY I SHOUTED
AND I HAVE NO ONE READY TO WHOM I CAN GIVE UP THE ARCHIVES OF THE GOVERNMENT
I SHALL BE HAPPY TO TAKE CHARGE OF THEM SAID SIR FERDINANDO
THEY OF COURSE MUST ALL BE ALTERED
OR OF THE HABITS OF OUR PEOPLE IT IS QUITE IMPOSSIBLE
YOUR POWER IS SUFFICIENT I SAID
IF YOU WILL GIVE US YOUR PROMISE TO MEET CAPTAIN BATTLEAX HERE AT THIS TIME TO MORROW WE WILL STRETCH A POINT AND DELAY THE DEPARTURE OF THE JOHN BRIGHT FOR TWENTY FOUR HOURS
AND THIS PLAN WAS ADOPTED TOO IN ORDER TO EXTRACT FROM ME A PROMISE THAT I WOULD DEPART IN PEACE
IN EVERY WAY THEY SOUGHT TO UNDERMINE THE AUTHORITY OF SAINT PAUL
THEY SAID TO THE GALATIANS YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO THINK HIGHLY OF PAUL
HE WAS THE LAST TO TURN TO CHRIST
PAUL CAME LATER AND IS BENEATH US
INDEED HE PERSECUTED THE CHURCH OF CHRIST FOR A LONG TIME
DO YOU SUPPOSE THAT GOD FOR THE SAKE OF A FEW LUTHERAN HERETICS WOULD DISOWN HIS ENTIRE CHURCH
AGAINST THESE BOASTING FALSE APOSTLES PAUL BOLDLY DEFENDS HIS APOSTOLIC AUTHORITY AND MINISTRY
AS THE AMBASSADOR OF A GOVERNMENT IS HONORED FOR HIS OFFICE AND NOT FOR HIS PRIVATE PERSON SO THE MINISTER OF CHRIST SHOULD EXALT HIS OFFICE IN ORDER TO GAIN AUTHORITY AMONG MEN
PAUL TAKES PRIDE IN HIS MINISTRY NOT TO HIS OWN PRAISE BUT TO THE PRAISE OF GOD
PAUL AN APOSTLE NOT OF MEN ET CETERA
EITHER HE CALLS MINISTERS THROUGH THE AGENCY OF MEN OR HE CALLS THEM DIRECTLY AS HE CALLED THE PROPHETS AND APOSTLES
PAUL DECLARES THAT THE FALSE APOSTLES WERE CALLED OR SENT NEITHER BY MEN NOR BY MAN
THE MOST THEY COULD CLAIM IS THAT THEY WERE SENT BY OTHERS
HE MENTIONS THE APOSTLES FIRST BECAUSE THEY WERE APPOINTED DIRECTLY BY GOD
THE CALL IS NOT TO BE TAKEN LIGHTLY
FOR A PERSON TO POSSESS KNOWLEDGE IS NOT ENOUGH
IT SPOILS ONE'S BEST WORK
WHEN I WAS A YOUNG MAN I THOUGHT PAUL WAS MAKING TOO MUCH OF HIS CALL
I DID NOT THEN REALIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF THE MINISTRY
I KNEW NOTHING OF THE DOCTRINE OF FAITH BECAUSE WE WERE TAUGHT SOPHISTRY INSTEAD OF CERTAINTY AND NOBODY UNDERSTOOD SPIRITUAL BOASTING
THIS IS NO SINFUL PRIDE IT IS HOLY PRIDE
AND GOD THE FATHER WHO RAISED HIM FROM THE DEAD
THE CLAUSE SEEMS SUPERFLUOUS ON FIRST SIGHT
THESE PERVERTERS OF THE RIGHTEOUSNESS OF CHRIST RESIST THE FATHER AND THE SON AND THE WORKS OF THEM BOTH
IN THIS WHOLE EPISTLE PAUL TREATS OF THE RESURRECTION OF CHRIST
BY HIS RESURRECTION CHRIST WON THE VICTORY OVER LAW SIN FLESH WORLD DEVIL DEATH HELL AND EVERY EVIL
VERSE TWO
AND ALL THE BRETHREN WHICH ARE WITH ME
THIS SHOULD GO FAR IN SHUTTING THE MOUTHS OF THE FALSE APOSTLES
ALTHOUGH THE BRETHREN WITH ME ARE NOT APOSTLES LIKE MYSELF YET THEY ARE ALL OF ONE MIND WITH ME THINK WRITE AND TEACH AS I DO
THEY DO NOT GO WHERE THE ENEMIES OF THE GOSPEL PREDOMINATE THEY GO WHERE THE CHRISTIANS ARE
WHY DO THEY NOT INVADE THE CATHOLIC PROVINCES AND PREACH THEIR DOCTRINE TO GODLESS PRINCES BISHOPS AND DOCTORS AS WE HAVE DONE BY THE HELP OF GOD
WE LOOK FOR THAT REWARD WHICH EYE HATH NOT SEEN NOR EAR HEARD NEITHER HATH ENTERED INTO THE HEART OF MAN
NOT ALL THE GALATIANS HAD BECOME PERVERTED
THESE MEANS CANNOT BE CONTAMINATED
THEY REMAIN DIVINE REGARDLESS OF MEN'S OPINION
WHEREVER THE MEANS OF GRACE ARE FOUND THERE IS THE HOLY CHURCH EVEN THOUGH ANTICHRIST REIGNS THERE
SO MUCH FOR THE TITLE OF THE EPISTLE NOW FOLLOWS THE GREETING OF THE APOSTLE VERSE THREE
GRACE BE TO YOU AND PEACE FROM GOD THE FATHER AND FROM OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST
THE TERMS OF GRACE AND PEACE ARE COMMON TERMS WITH PAUL AND ARE NOW PRETTY WELL UNDERSTOOD
THE GREETING OF THE APOSTLE IS REFRESHING
GRACE INVOLVES THE REMISSION OF SINS PEACE AND A HAPPY CONSCIENCE
THE WORLD BRANDS THIS A PERNICIOUS DOCTRINE
EXPERIENCE PROVES THIS
HOWEVER THE GRACE AND PEACE OF GOD WILL
MEN SHOULD NOT SPECULATE ABOUT THE NATURE OF GOD
WAS IT NOT ENOUGH TO SAY FROM GOD THE FATHER
TO DO SO IS TO LOSE GOD ALTOGETHER BECAUSE GOD BECOMES INTOLERABLE WHEN WE SEEK TO MEASURE AND TO COMPREHEND HIS INFINITE MAJESTY
HE CAME DOWN TO EARTH LIVED AMONG MEN SUFFERED WAS CRUCIFIED AND THEN HE DIED STANDING CLEARLY BEFORE US SO THAT OUR HEARTS AND EYES MAY FASTEN UPON HIM
EMBRACE HIM AND FORGET ABOUT THE NATURE OF GOD
DID NOT CHRIST HIMSELF SAY I AM THE WAY AND THE TRUTH AND THE LIFE NO MAN COMETH UNTO THE FATHER BUT BY ME
WHEN YOU ARGUE ABOUT THE NATURE OF GOD APART FROM THE QUESTION OF JUSTIFICATION YOU MAY BE AS PROFOUND AS YOU LIKE
WE ARE TO HEAR CHRIST WHO HAS BEEN APPOINTED BY THE FATHER AS OUR DIVINE TEACHER
AT THE SAME TIME PAUL CONFIRMS OUR CREED THAT CHRIST IS VERY GOD
THAT CHRIST IS VERY GOD IS APPARENT IN THAT PAUL ASCRIBES TO HIM DIVINE POWERS EQUALLY WITH THE FATHER AS FOR INSTANCE THE POWER TO DISPENSE GRACE AND PEACE
TO BESTOW PEACE AND GRACE LIES IN THE PROVINCE OF GOD WHO ALONE CAN CREATE THESE BLESSINGS THE ANGELS CANNOT
OTHERWISE PAUL SHOULD HAVE WRITTEN GRACE FROM GOD THE FATHER AND PEACE FROM OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST
THE ARIANS TOOK CHRIST FOR A NOBLE AND PERFECT CREATURE SUPERIOR EVEN TO THE ANGELS BECAUSE BY HIM GOD CREATED HEAVEN AND EARTH
MOHAMMED ALSO SPEAKS HIGHLY OF CHRIST
PAUL STICKS TO HIS THEME
HE NEVER LOSES SIGHT OF THE PURPOSE OF HIS EPISTLE
NOT GOLD OR SILVER OR PASCHAL LAMBS OR AN ANGEL BUT HIMSELF WHAT FOR
NOT FOR A CROWN OR A KINGDOM OR OUR GOODNESS BUT FOR OUR SINS
UNDERSCORE THESE WORDS FOR THEY ARE FULL OF COMFORT FOR SORE CONSCIENCES
HOW MAY WE OBTAIN REMISSION OF OUR SINS
PAUL ANSWERS THE MAN WHO IS NAMED JESUS CHRIST AND THE SON OF GOD GAVE HIMSELF FOR OUR SINS
SINCE CHRIST WAS GIVEN FOR OUR SINS IT STANDS TO REASON THAT THEY CANNOT BE PUT AWAY BY OUR OWN EFFORTS
THIS SENTENCE ALSO DEFINES OUR SINS AS GREAT SO GREAT IN FACT THAT THE WHOLE WORLD COULD NOT MAKE AMENDS FOR A SINGLE SIN
THE GREATNESS OF THE RANSOM CHRIST THE SON OF GOD INDICATES THIS
THE VICIOUS CHARACTER OF SIN IS BROUGHT OUT BY THE WORDS WHO GAVE HIMSELF FOR OUR SINS
BUT WE ARE CARELESS WE MAKE LIGHT OF SIN
WE THINK THAT BY SOME LITTLE WORK OR MERIT WE CAN DISMISS SIN
THIS PASSAGE THEN BEARS OUT THE FACT THAT ALL MEN ARE SOLD UNDER SIN
THIS ATTITUDE SPRINGS FROM A FALSE CONCEPTION OF SIN THE CONCEPTION THAT SIN IS A SMALL MATTER EASILY TAKEN CARE OF BY GOOD WORKS THAT WE MUST PRESENT OURSELVES UNTO GOD WITH A GOOD CONSCIENCE THAT WE MUST FEEL NO SIN BEFORE WE MAY FEEL THAT CHRIST WAS GIVEN FOR OUR SINS
THIS ATTITUDE IS UNIVERSAL AND PARTICULARLY DEVELOPED IN THOSE WHO CONSIDER THEMSELVES BETTER THAN OTHERS
BUT THE REAL SIGNIFICANCE AND COMFORT OF THE WORDS FOR OUR SINS IS LOST UPON THEM
ON THE OTHER HAND WE ARE NOT TO REGARD THEM AS SO TERRIBLE THAT WE MUST DESPAIR
WE WANT YOU TO HELP US PUBLISH SOME LEADING WORK OF LUTHER'S FOR THE GENERAL AMERICAN MARKET WILL YOU DO IT
THE CONDITION IS THAT I WILL BE PERMITTED TO MAKE LUTHER TALK AMERICAN STREAMLINE HIM SO TO SPEAK BECAUSE YOU WILL NEVER GET PEOPLE WHETHER IN OR OUTSIDE THE LUTHERAN CHURCH ACTUALLY TO READ LUTHER UNLESS WE MAKE HIM TALK AS HE WOULD TALK TODAY TO AMERICANS
LET US BEGIN WITH THAT HIS COMMENTARY ON GALATIANS
THE UNDERTAKING WHICH SEEMED SO ATTRACTIVE WHEN VIEWED AS A LITERARY TASK PROVED A MOST DIFFICULT ONE AND AT TIMES BECAME OPPRESSIVE
IT WAS WRITTEN IN LATIN
THE WORK HAD TO BE CONDENSED
A WORD SHOULD NOW BE SAID ABOUT THE ORIGIN OF LUTHER'S COMMENTARY ON GALATIANS
MUCH LATER WHEN A FRIEND OF HIS WAS PREPARING AN EDITION OF ALL HIS LATIN WORKS HE REMARKED TO HIS HOME CIRCLE IF I HAD MY WAY ABOUT IT THEY WOULD REPUBLISH ONLY THOSE OF MY BOOKS WHICH HAVE DOCTRINE MY GALATIANS FOR INSTANCE
IN OTHER WORDS THESE THREE MEN TOOK DOWN THE LECTURES WHICH LUTHER ADDRESSED TO HIS STUDENTS IN THE COURSE OF GALATIANS AND ROERER PREPARED THE MANUSCRIPT FOR THE PRINTER
IT PRESENTS LIKE NO OTHER OF LUTHER'S WRITINGS THE CENTRAL THOUGHT OF CHRISTIANITY THE JUSTIFICATION OF THE SINNER FOR THE SAKE OF CHRIST'S MERITS ALONE
BUT THE ESSENCE OF LUTHER'S LECTURES IS THERE
THE LORD WHO HAS GIVEN US POWER TO TEACH AND TO HEAR LET HIM ALSO GIVE US THE POWER TO SERVE AND TO DO LUKE TWO
THE WORD OF OUR GOD SHALL STAND FOREVER
MAINHALL LIKED ALEXANDER BECAUSE HE WAS AN ENGINEER
HE HAD PRECONCEIVED IDEAS ABOUT EVERYTHING AND HIS IDEA ABOUT AMERICANS WAS THAT THEY SHOULD BE ENGINEERS OR MECHANICS
IT'S TREMENDOUSLY WELL PUT ON TOO
IT'S BEEN ON ONLY TWO WEEKS AND I'VE BEEN HALF A DOZEN TIMES ALREADY
DO YOU KNOW ALEXANDER MAINHALL LOOKED WITH PERPLEXITY UP INTO THE TOP OF THE HANSOM AND RUBBED HIS PINK CHEEK WITH HIS GLOVED FINGER DO YOU KNOW I SOMETIMES THINK OF TAKING TO CRITICISM SERIOUSLY MYSELF
SHE SAVES HER HAND TOO SHE'S AT HER BEST IN THE SECOND ACT
HE'S BEEN WANTING TO MARRY HILDA THESE THREE YEARS AND MORE
SHE DOESN'T TAKE UP WITH ANYBODY YOU KNOW
IRENE BURGOYNE ONE OF HER FAMILY TOLD ME IN CONFIDENCE THAT THERE WAS A ROMANCE SOMEWHERE BACK IN THE BEGINNING
MAINHALL VOUCHED FOR HER CONSTANCY WITH A LOFTINESS THAT MADE ALEXANDER SMILE EVEN WHILE A KIND OF RAPID EXCITEMENT WAS TINGLING THROUGH HIM
HE'S ANOTHER WHO'S AWFULLY KEEN ABOUT HER LET ME INTRODUCE YOU
SIR HARRY TOWNE MISTER BARTLEY ALEXANDER THE AMERICAN ENGINEER
I SAY SIR HARRY THE LITTLE GIRL'S GOING FAMOUSLY TO NIGHT ISN'T SHE
DO YOU KNOW I THOUGHT THE DANCE A BIT CONSCIOUS TO NIGHT FOR THE FIRST TIME
WESTMERE AND I WERE BACK AFTER THE FIRST ACT AND WE THOUGHT SHE SEEMED QUITE UNCERTAIN OF HERSELF
A LITTLE ATTACK OF NERVES POSSIBLY
HE WAS BEGINNING TO FEEL A KEEN INTEREST IN THE SLENDER BAREFOOT DONKEY GIRL WHO SLIPPED IN AND OUT OF THE PLAY SINGING LIKE SOME ONE WINDING THROUGH A HILLY FIELD
ONE NIGHT WHEN HE AND WINIFRED WERE SITTING TOGETHER ON THE BRIDGE HE TOLD HER THAT THINGS HAD HAPPENED WHILE HE WAS STUDYING ABROAD THAT HE WAS SORRY FOR ONE THING IN PARTICULAR AND HE ASKED HER WHETHER SHE THOUGHT SHE OUGHT TO KNOW ABOUT THEM
SHE CONSIDERED A MOMENT AND THEN SAID NO I THINK NOT THOUGH I AM GLAD YOU ASK ME
AFTER THAT IT WAS EASY TO FORGET ACTUALLY TO FORGET
OF COURSE HE REFLECTED SHE ALWAYS HAD THAT COMBINATION OF SOMETHING HOMELY AND SENSIBLE AND SOMETHING UTTERLY WILD AND DAFT
SHE MUST CARE ABOUT THE THEATRE A GREAT DEAL MORE THAN SHE USED TO
I'M GLAD SHE'S HELD HER OWN SINCE
AFTER ALL WE WERE AWFULLY YOUNG
I SHOULDN'T WONDER IF SHE COULD LAUGH ABOUT IT WITH ME NOW
HILDA WAS VERY NICE TO HIM AND HE SAT ON THE EDGE OF HIS CHAIR FLUSHED WITH HIS CONVERSATIONAL EFFORTS AND MOVING HIS CHIN ABOUT NERVOUSLY OVER HIS HIGH COLLAR
THEY ASKED HIM TO COME TO SEE THEM IN CHELSEA AND THEY SPOKE VERY TENDERLY OF HILDA
LAMB WOULDN'T CARE A GREAT DEAL ABOUT MANY OF THEM I FANCY
WHEN BARTLEY ARRIVED AT BEDFORD SQUARE ON SUNDAY EVENING MARIE THE PRETTY LITTLE FRENCH GIRL MET HIM AT THE DOOR AND CONDUCTED HIM UPSTAIRS
I SHOULD NEVER HAVE ASKED YOU IF MOLLY HAD BEEN HERE FOR I REMEMBER YOU DON'T LIKE ENGLISH COOKERY
I HAVEN'T HAD A CHANCE YET TO TELL YOU WHAT A JOLLY LITTLE PLACE I THINK THIS IS
THEY ARE ALL SKETCHES MADE ABOUT THE VILLA D'ESTE YOU SEE
THOSE FELLOWS ARE ALL VERY LOYAL EVEN MAINHALL
I'VE MANAGED TO SAVE SOMETHING EVERY YEAR AND THAT WITH HELPING MY THREE SISTERS NOW AND THEN AND TIDING POOR COUSIN MIKE OVER BAD SEASONS
IT'S NOT PARTICULARLY RARE SHE SAID BUT SOME OF IT WAS MY MOTHER'S
THERE WAS WATERCRESS SOUP AND SOLE AND A DELIGHTFUL OMELETTE STUFFED WITH MUSHROOMS AND TRUFFLES AND TWO SMALL RARE DUCKLINGS AND ARTICHOKES AND A DRY YELLOW RHONE WINE OF WHICH BARTLEY HAD ALWAYS BEEN VERY FOND
THERE IS NOTHING ELSE THAT LOOKS SO JOLLY
THANK YOU BUT I DON'T LIKE IT SO WELL AS THIS
HAVE YOU BEEN IN PARIS MUCH THESE LATE YEARS
THERE ARE FEW CHANGES IN THE OLD QUARTER
DON'T I THOUGH I'M SO SORRY TO HEAR IT HOW DID HER SON TURN OUT
HER HAIR IS STILL LIKE FLAX AND HER BLUE EYES ARE JUST LIKE A BABY'S AND SHE HAS THE SAME THREE FRECKLES ON HER LITTLE NOSE AND TALKS ABOUT GOING BACK TO HER BAINS DE MER
HOW JOLLY IT WAS BEING YOUNG HILDA
DO YOU REMEMBER THAT FIRST WALK WE TOOK TOGETHER IN PARIS
COME WE'LL HAVE OUR COFFEE IN THE OTHER ROOM AND YOU CAN SMOKE
I THINK WE DID SHE ANSWERED DEMURELY
WHAT SHE WANTED FROM US WAS NEITHER OUR FLOWERS NOR OUR FRANCS BUT JUST OUR YOUTH
THEY WERE BOTH REMEMBERING WHAT THE WOMAN HAD SAID WHEN SHE TOOK THE MONEY GOD GIVE YOU A HAPPY LOVE
THE STRANGE WOMAN AND HER PASSIONATE SENTENCE THAT RANG OUT SO SHARPLY HAD FRIGHTENED THEM BOTH
BARTLEY STARTED WHEN HILDA RANG THE LITTLE BELL BESIDE HER DEAR ME WHY DID YOU DO THAT
IT WAS VERY JOLLY HE MURMURED LAZILY AS MARIE CAME IN TO TAKE AWAY THE COFFEE
HAVE I TOLD YOU ABOUT MY NEW PLAY
WHEN SHE FINISHED ALEXANDER SHOOK HIMSELF OUT OF A REVERIE
NONSENSE OF COURSE I CAN'T REALLY SING EXCEPT THE WAY MY MOTHER AND GRANDMOTHER DID BEFORE ME
IT'S REALLY TOO WARM IN THIS ROOM TO SING DON'T YOU FEEL IT
ALEXANDER WENT OVER AND OPENED THE WINDOW FOR HER
THERE JUST IN FRONT
HE STOOD A LITTLE BEHIND HER AND TRIED TO STEADY HIMSELF AS HE SAID IT'S SOFT AND MISTY SEE HOW WHITE THE STARS ARE
FOR A LONG TIME NEITHER HILDA NOR BARTLEY SPOKE
HE FELT A TREMOR RUN THROUGH THE SLENDER YELLOW FIGURE IN FRONT OF HIM
BARTLEY LEANED OVER HER SHOULDER WITHOUT TOUCHING HER AND WHISPERED IN HER EAR YOU ARE GIVING ME A CHANCE YES
ALEXANDER UNCLENCHED THE TWO HANDS AT HIS SIDES
THE STOP AT QUEENSTOWN THE TEDIOUS PASSAGE UP THE MERSEY WERE THINGS THAT HE NOTED DIMLY THROUGH HIS GROWING IMPATIENCE
SHE BLUSHED AND SMILED AND FUMBLED HIS CARD IN HER CONFUSION BEFORE SHE RAN UPSTAIRS
ALEXANDER PACED UP AND DOWN THE HALLWAY BUTTONING AND UNBUTTONING HIS OVERCOAT UNTIL SHE RETURNED AND TOOK HIM UP TO HILDA'S LIVING ROOM
THE ROOM WAS EMPTY WHEN HE ENTERED
ALEXANDER DID NOT SIT DOWN
I FELT IT IN MY BONES WHEN I WOKE THIS MORNING THAT SOMETHING SPLENDID WAS GOING TO TURN UP
I THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE SISTER KATE OR COUSIN MIKE WOULD BE HAPPENING ALONG
SHE PUSHED HIM TOWARD THE BIG CHAIR BY THE FIRE AND SAT DOWN ON A STOOL AT THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE HEARTH HER KNEES DRAWN UP TO HER CHIN LAUGHING LIKE A HAPPY LITTLE GIRL
WHEN DID YOU COME BARTLEY AND HOW DID IT HAPPEN YOU HAVEN'T SPOKEN A WORD
I GOT IN ABOUT TEN MINUTES AGO
ALEXANDER LEANED FORWARD AND WARMED HIS HANDS BEFORE THE BLAZE
BARTLEY BENT LOWER OVER THE FIRE
SHE LOOKED AT HIS HEAVY SHOULDERS AND BIG DETERMINED HEAD THRUST FORWARD LIKE A CATAPULT IN LEASH
I'LL DO ANYTHING YOU WISH ME TO BARTLEY SHE SAID TREMULOUSLY
I CAN'T STAND SEEING YOU MISERABLE
HE PULLED UP A WINDOW AS IF THE AIR WERE HEAVY
HILDA WATCHED HIM FROM HER CORNER TREMBLING AND SCARCELY BREATHING DARK SHADOWS GROWING ABOUT HER EYES IT
BUT IT'S WORSE NOW IT'S UNBEARABLE
I GET NOTHING BUT MISERY OUT OF EITHER
THE WORLD IS ALL THERE JUST AS IT USED TO BE BUT I CAN'T GET AT IT ANY MORE
IT WAS MYSELF I WAS DEFYING HILDA
HILDA'S FACE QUIVERED BUT SHE WHISPERED YES I THINK IT MUST HAVE BEEN
BUT WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME WHEN YOU WERE HERE IN THE SUMMER
ALEXANDER GROANED I MEANT TO BUT SOMEHOW I COULDN'T
SHE PRESSED HIS HAND GENTLY IN GRATITUDE
WEREN'T YOU HAPPY THEN AT ALL
SHE CLOSED HER EYES AND TOOK A DEEP BREATH AS IF TO DRAW IN AGAIN THE FRAGRANCE OF THOSE DAYS
HE MOVED UNEASILY AND HIS CHAIR CREAKED
YES YES SHE HURRIED PULLING HER HAND GENTLY AWAY FROM HIM
PLEASE TELL ME ONE THING BARTLEY AT LEAST TELL ME THAT YOU BELIEVE I THOUGHT I WAS MAKING YOU HAPPY
YES HILDA I KNOW THAT HE SAID SIMPLY
I UNDERSTAND BARTLEY I WAS WRONG
BUT I DIDN'T KNOW YOU'VE ONLY TO TELL ME NOW
WHAT I MEAN IS THAT I WANT YOU TO PROMISE NEVER TO SEE ME AGAIN NO MATTER HOW OFTEN I COME NO MATTER HOW HARD I BEG
KEEP AWAY IF YOU WISH WHEN HAVE I EVER FOLLOWED YOU
ALEXANDER ROSE AND SHOOK HIMSELF ANGRILY YES I KNOW I'M COWARDLY
HE TOOK HER ROUGHLY IN HIS ARMS DO YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN
OH BARTLEY WHAT AM I TO DO
I WILL ASK THE LEAST IMAGINABLE BUT I MUST HAVE SOMETHING
I MUST KNOW ABOUT YOU
THE SIGHT OF YOU BARTLEY TO SEE YOU LIVING AND HAPPY AND SUCCESSFUL CAN I NEVER MAKE YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT THAT MEANS TO ME
YOU SEE LOVING SOME ONE AS I LOVE YOU MAKES THE WHOLE WORLD DIFFERENT
AND THEN YOU CAME BACK NOT CARING VERY MUCH BUT IT MADE NO DIFFERENCE
BARTLEY BENT OVER AND TOOK HER IN HIS ARMS KISSING HER MOUTH AND HER WET TIRED EYES
DON'T CRY DON'T CRY HE WHISPERED
WE'VE TORTURED EACH OTHER ENOUGH FOR TONIGHT
THE ARMY FOUND THE PEOPLE IN POVERTY AND LEFT THEM IN COMPARATIVE WEALTH
BUT A WORD FURTHER CONCERNING THE EXPEDITION IN GENERAL
IT WAS THROUGH FLOYD'S ADVICE THAT BUCHANAN ORDERED THE MILITARY EXPEDITION TO UTAH OSTENSIBLY TO INSTALL CERTAIN FEDERAL OFFICIALS AND TO REPRESS AN ALLEGED INFANTILE REBELLION WHICH IN FACT HAD NEVER COME INTO EXISTENCE BUT IN REALITY TO FURTHER THE INTERESTS OF THE SECESSIONISTS
MOREOVER HAD THE PEOPLE BEEN INCLINED TO REBELLION WHAT GREATER OPPORTUNITY COULD THEY HAVE WISHED
ALREADY A NORTH AND A SOUTH WERE TALKED OF WHY NOT SET UP ALSO A WEST
THEY KNEW NO NORTH NO SOUTH NO EAST NO WEST THEY STOOD POSITIVELY BY THE CONSTITUTION AND WOULD HAVE NOTHING TO DO IN THE BLOODY STRIFE BETWEEN BROTHERS UNLESS INDEED THEY WERE SUMMONED BY THE AUTHORITY TO WHICH THEY HAD ALREADY ONCE LOYALLY RESPONDED TO FURNISH MEN AND ARMS FOR THEIR COUNTRY'S NEED
WHAT THE LATTER DAY SAINTS CALL CELESTIAL MARRIAGE IS CHARACTERISTIC OF THE CHURCH AND IS IN VERY GENERAL PRACTISE BUT OF CELESTIAL MARRIAGE PLURALITY OF WIVES WAS AN INCIDENT NEVER AN ESSENTIAL
WE BELIEVE IN A LITERAL RESURRECTION AND AN ACTUAL HEREAFTER IN WHICH FUTURE STATE SHALL BE RECOGNIZED EVERY SANCTIFIED AND AUTHORIZED RELATIONSHIP EXISTING HERE ON EARTH OF PARENT AND CHILD BROTHER AND SISTER HUSBAND AND WIFE
IT HAS BEEN MY PRIVILEGE TO TREAD THE SOIL OF MANY LANDS TO OBSERVE THE CUSTOMS AND STUDY THE HABITS OF MORE NATIONS THAN ONE AND I HAVE YET TO FIND THE PLACE AND MEET THE PEOPLE WHERE AND WITH WHOM THE PURITY OF MAN AND WOMAN IS HELD MORE PRECIOUS THAN AMONG THE MALIGNED MORMONS IN THE MOUNTAIN VALLEYS OF THE WEST
AT THE INCEPTION OF PLURAL MARRIAGE AMONG THE LATTER DAY SAINTS THERE WAS NO LAW NATIONAL OR STATE AGAINST ITS PRACTISE
IN EIGHTEEN SIXTY TWO A LAW WAS ENACTED WITH THE PURPOSE OF SUPPRESSING PLURAL MARRIAGE AND AS HAD BEEN PREDICTED IN THE NATIONAL SENATE PRIOR TO ITS PASSAGE IT LAY FOR MANY YEARS A DEAD LETTER
FEDERAL JUDGES AND UNITED STATES ATTORNEYS IN UTAH WHO WERE NOT MORMONS NOR LOVERS OF MORMONISM REFUSED TO ENTERTAIN COMPLAINTS OR PROSECUTE CASES UNDER THE LAW BECAUSE OF ITS MANIFEST INJUSTICE AND INADEQUACY
THIS MEANT THAT FOR AN ALLEGED MISDEMEANOR FOR WHICH CONGRESS PRESCRIBED A MAXIMUM PENALTY OF SIX MONTHS IMPRISONMENT AND A FINE OF THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS A MAN MIGHT BE IMPRISONED FOR LIFE AYE FOR MANY TERMS OF A MAN'S NATURAL LIFE DID THE COURT'S POWER TO ENFORCE ITS SENTENCES EXTEND SO FAR AND MIGHT BE FINED MILLIONS OF DOLLARS
BEFORE THIS TRAVESTY ON THE ADMINISTRATION OF LAW COULD BE BROUGHT BEFORE THE COURT OF LAST RESORT AND THERE MEET WITH THE REVERSAL AND REBUKE IT DESERVED MEN WERE IMPRISONED UNDER SENTENCES OF MANY YEARS DURATION
THE PEOPLE CONTESTED THESE MEASURES ONE BY ONE IN THE COURTS PRESENTING IN CASE AFTER CASE THE DIFFERENT PHASES OF THE SUBJECT AND URGING THE UNCONSTITUTIONALITY OF THE MEASURE
THEN THE CHURCH WAS DISINCORPORATED AND ITS PROPERTY BOTH REAL AND PERSONAL CONFISCATED AND ESCHEATED TO THE GOVERNMENT OF THE UNITED STATES AND ALTHOUGH THE PERSONAL PROPERTY WAS SOON RESTORED REAL ESTATE OF GREAT VALUE LONG LAY IN THE HANDS OF THE COURT'S RECEIVER AND THE MORMON CHURCH HAD TO PAY THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT HIGH RENTAL ON ITS OWN PROPERTY
AND SO THE STORY OF MORMONISM RUNS ON ITS FINALE HAS NOT YET BEEN WRITTEN THE CURRENT PRESS PRESENTS CONTINUOUSLY NEW STAGES OF ITS PROGRESS NEW DEVELOPMENTS OF ITS PLAN
ON THE SIXTH OF APRIL EIGHTEEN THIRTY THE CHURCH OF JESUS CHRIST OF LATTER DAY SAINTS WAS FORMALLY ORGANIZED AND THUS TOOK ON A LEGAL EXISTENCE
ITS ORIGIN WAS SMALL A GERM AN INSIGNIFICANT SEED HARDLY TO BE THOUGHT OF AS LIKELY TO AROUSE OPPOSITION
INSTEAD OF BUT SIX REGULARLY AFFILIATED MEMBERS AND AT MOST TWO SCORE OF ADHERENTS THE ORGANIZATION NUMBERS TODAY MANY HUNDRED THOUSAND SOULS
IN PLACE OF A SINGLE HAMLET IN THE SMALLEST CORNER OF WHICH THE MEMBERS COULD HAVE CONGREGATED THERE NOW ARE ABOUT SEVENTY STAKES OF ZION AND ABOUT SEVEN HUNDRED ORGANIZED WARDS EACH WARD AND STAKE WITH ITS FULL COMPLEMENT OF OFFICERS AND PRIESTHOOD ORGANIZATIONS
THE PRACTISE OF GATHERING ITS PROSELYTES INTO ONE PLACE PREVENTS THE BUILDING UP AND STRENGTHENING OF FOREIGN BRANCHES AND INASMUCH AS EXTENSIVE AND STRONG ORGANIZATIONS ARE SELDOM MET WITH ABROAD VERY ERRONEOUS IDEAS EXIST CONCERNING THE STRENGTH OF THE CHURCH
NEVERTHELESS THE MUSTARD SEED AMONG THE SMALLEST OF ALL SEEDS HAS ATTAINED THE PROPORTIONS OF A TREE AND THE BIRDS OF THE AIR ARE NESTING IN ITS BRANCHES THE ACORN IS NOW AN OAK OFFERING PROTECTION AND THE SWEETS OF SATISFACTION TO EVERY EARNEST PILGRIM JOURNEYING ITS WAY FOR TRUTH
THEIR EYES WERE FROM THE FIRST TURNED IN ANTICIPATION TOWARD THE EVENING SUN NOT MERELY THAT THE WORK OF PROSELYTING SHOULD BE CARRIED ON IN THE WEST BUT THAT THE HEADQUARTERS OF THE CHURCH SHOULD BE THERE ESTABLISHED
THE BOOK OF MORMON HAD TAUGHT THE PEOPLE THE TRUE ORIGIN AND DESTINY OF THE AMERICAN INDIANS AND TOWARD THIS DARK SKINNED REMNANT OF A ONCE MIGHTY PEOPLE THE MISSIONARIES OF MORMONISM EARLY TURNED THEIR EYES AND WITH THEIR EYES WENT THEIR HEARTS AND THEIR HOPES
IT IS NOTABLE THAT THE INDIAN TRIBES HAVE GENERALLY REGARDED THE RELIGION OF THE LATTER DAY SAINTS WITH FAVOR SEEING IN THE BOOK OF MORMON STRIKING AGREEMENT WITH THEIR OWN TRADITIONS
THE FIRST WELL ESTABLISHED SEAT OF THE CHURCH WAS IN THE PRETTY LITTLE TOWN OF KIRTLAND OHIO ALMOST WITHIN SIGHT OF LAKE ERIE AND HERE SOON ROSE THE FIRST TEMPLE OF MODERN TIMES
TO THE FERVENT LATTER DAY SAINT A TEMPLE IS NOT SIMPLY A CHURCH BUILDING A HOUSE FOR RELIGIOUS ASSEMBLY
SOON THOUSANDS OF CONVERTS HAD RENTED OR PURCHASED HOMES IN MISSOURI INDEPENDENCE JACKSON COUNTY BEING THEIR CENTER BUT FROM THE FIRST THEY WERE UNPOPULAR AMONG THE MISSOURIANS
THE LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR LILBURN W BOGGS AFTERWARD GOVERNOR WAS A PRONOUNCED MORMON HATER AND THROUGHOUT THE PERIOD OF THE TROUBLES HE MANIFESTED SYMPATHY WITH THE PERSECUTORS
THEIR SUFFERINGS HAVE NEVER YET BEEN FITLY CHRONICLED BY HUMAN SCRIBE
MAKING THEIR WAY ACROSS THE RIVER MOST OF THE REFUGEES FOUND SHELTER AMONG THE MORE HOSPITABLE PEOPLE OF CLAY COUNTY AND AFTERWARD ESTABLISHED THEMSELVES IN CALDWELL COUNTY THEREIN FOUNDING THE CITY OF FAR WEST
A SMALL SETTLEMENT HAD BEEN FOUNDED BY MORMON FAMILIES ON SHOAL CREEK AND HERE ON THE THIRTIETH OF OCTOBER EIGHTEEN THIRTY EIGHT A COMPANY OF TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY FELL UPON THE HAPLESS SETTLERS AND BUTCHERED A SCORE
BE IT SAID TO THE HONOR OF SOME OF THE OFFICERS ENTRUSTED WITH THE TERRIBLE COMMISSION THAT WHEN THEY LEARNED ITS TRUE SIGNIFICANCE THEY RESIGNED THEIR AUTHORITY RATHER THAN HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH WHAT THEY DESIGNATED A COLD BLOODED BUTCHERY
OH WHAT A RECORD TO READ WHAT A PICTURE TO GAZE UPON HOW AWFUL THE FACT
AMERICAN SCHOOL BOYS READ WITH EMOTIONS OF HORROR OF THE ALBIGENSES DRIVEN BEATEN AND KILLED WITH A PAPAL LEGATE DIRECTING THE BUTCHERY AND OF THE VAUDOIS HUNTED AND HOUNDED LIKE BEASTS AS THE EFFECT OF A ROYAL DECREE AND THEY YET SHALL READ IN THE HISTORY OF THEIR OWN COUNTRY OF SCENES AS TERRIBLE AS THESE IN THE EXHIBITION OF INJUSTICE AND INHUMAN HATE
WHO BEGAN THE QUARREL WAS IT THE MORMONS
AS A SAMPLE OF THE PRESS COMMENTS AGAINST THE BRUTALITY OF THE MISSOURIANS I QUOTE A PARAGRAPH FROM THE QUINCY ARGUS MARCH SIXTEENTH EIGHTEEN THIRTY NINE
IT WILL BE OBSERVED THAT AN ORGANIZED MOB AIDED BY MANY OF THE CIVIL AND MILITARY OFFICERS OF MISSOURI WITH GOVERNOR BOGGS AT THEIR HEAD HAVE BEEN THE PROMINENT ACTORS IN THIS BUSINESS INCITED TOO IT APPEARS AGAINST THE MORMONS BY POLITICAL HATRED AND BY THE ADDITIONAL MOTIVES OF PLUNDER AND REVENGE
HESTER PRYNNE WENT ONE DAY TO THE MANSION OF GOVERNOR BELLINGHAM WITH A PAIR OF GLOVES WHICH SHE HAD FRINGED AND EMBROIDERED TO HIS ORDER AND WHICH WERE TO BE WORN ON SOME GREAT OCCASION OF STATE FOR THOUGH THE CHANCES OF A POPULAR ELECTION HAD CAUSED THIS FORMER RULER TO DESCEND A STEP OR TWO FROM THE HIGHEST RANK HE STILL HELD AN HONOURABLE AND INFLUENTIAL PLACE AMONG THE COLONIAL MAGISTRACY
ANOTHER AND FAR MORE IMPORTANT REASON THAN THE DELIVERY OF A PAIR OF EMBROIDERED GLOVES IMPELLED HESTER AT THIS TIME TO SEEK AN INTERVIEW WITH A PERSONAGE OF SO MUCH POWER AND ACTIVITY IN THE AFFAIRS OF THE SETTLEMENT
AT THAT EPOCH OF PRISTINE SIMPLICITY HOWEVER MATTERS OF EVEN SLIGHTER PUBLIC INTEREST AND OF FAR LESS INTRINSIC WEIGHT THAN THE WELFARE OF HESTER AND HER CHILD WERE STRANGELY MIXED UP WITH THE DELIBERATIONS OF LEGISLATORS AND ACTS OF STATE
THE PERIOD WAS HARDLY IF AT ALL EARLIER THAN THAT OF OUR STORY WHEN A DISPUTE CONCERNING THE RIGHT OF PROPERTY IN A PIG NOT ONLY CAUSED A FIERCE AND BITTER CONTEST IN THE LEGISLATIVE BODY OF THE COLONY BUT RESULTED IN AN IMPORTANT MODIFICATION OF THE FRAMEWORK ITSELF OF THE LEGISLATURE
WE HAVE SPOKEN OF PEARL'S RICH AND LUXURIANT BEAUTY A BEAUTY THAT SHONE WITH DEEP AND VIVID TINTS A BRIGHT COMPLEXION EYES POSSESSING INTENSITY BOTH OF DEPTH AND GLOW AND HAIR ALREADY OF A DEEP GLOSSY BROWN AND WHICH IN AFTER YEARS WOULD BE NEARLY AKIN TO BLACK
IT WAS THE SCARLET LETTER IN ANOTHER FORM THE SCARLET LETTER ENDOWED WITH LIFE
THE MOTHER HERSELF AS IF THE RED IGNOMINY WERE SO DEEPLY SCORCHED INTO HER BRAIN THAT ALL HER CONCEPTIONS ASSUMED ITS FORM HAD CAREFULLY WROUGHT OUT THE SIMILITUDE LAVISHING MANY HOURS OF MORBID INGENUITY TO CREATE AN ANALOGY BETWEEN THE OBJECT OF HER AFFECTION AND THE EMBLEM OF HER GUILT AND TORTURE
BUT IN TRUTH PEARL WAS THE ONE AS WELL AS THE OTHER AND ONLY IN CONSEQUENCE OF THAT IDENTITY HAD HESTER CONTRIVED SO PERFECTLY TO REPRESENT THE SCARLET LETTER IN HER APPEARANCE
COME THEREFORE AND LET US FLING MUD AT THEM
BUT PEARL WHO WAS A DAUNTLESS CHILD AFTER FROWNING STAMPING HER FOOT AND SHAKING HER LITTLE HAND WITH A VARIETY OF THREATENING GESTURES SUDDENLY MADE A RUSH AT THE KNOT OF HER ENEMIES AND PUT THEM ALL TO FLIGHT
SHE SCREAMED AND SHOUTED TOO WITH A TERRIFIC VOLUME OF SOUND WHICH DOUBTLESS CAUSED THE HEARTS OF THE FUGITIVES TO QUAKE WITHIN THEM
IT WAS FURTHER DECORATED WITH STRANGE AND SEEMINGLY CABALISTIC FIGURES AND DIAGRAMS SUITABLE TO THE QUAINT TASTE OF THE AGE WHICH HAD BEEN DRAWN IN THE STUCCO WHEN NEWLY LAID ON AND HAD NOW GROWN HARD AND DURABLE FOR THE ADMIRATION OF AFTER TIMES
THEY APPROACHED THE DOOR WHICH WAS OF AN ARCHED FORM AND FLANKED ON EACH SIDE BY A NARROW TOWER OR PROJECTION OF THE EDIFICE IN BOTH OF WHICH WERE LATTICE WINDOWS THE WOODEN SHUTTERS TO CLOSE OVER THEM AT NEED
LIFTING THE IRON HAMMER THAT HUNG AT THE PORTAL HESTER PRYNNE GAVE A SUMMONS WHICH WAS ANSWERED BY ONE OF THE GOVERNOR'S BOND SERVANT A FREE BORN ENGLISHMAN BUT NOW A SEVEN YEARS SLAVE
YEA HIS HONOURABLE WORSHIP IS WITHIN BUT HE HATH A GODLY MINISTER OR TWO WITH HIM AND LIKEWISE A LEECH
YE MAY NOT SEE HIS WORSHIP NOW
WITH MANY VARIATIONS SUGGESTED BY THE NATURE OF HIS BUILDING MATERIALS DIVERSITY OF CLIMATE AND A DIFFERENT MODE OF SOCIAL LIFE GOVERNOR BELLINGHAM HAD PLANNED HIS NEW HABITATION AFTER THE RESIDENCES OF GENTLEMEN OF FAIR ESTATE IN HIS NATIVE LAND
ON THE TABLE IN TOKEN THAT THE SENTIMENT OF OLD ENGLISH HOSPITALITY HAD NOT BEEN LEFT BEHIND STOOD A LARGE PEWTER TANKARD AT THE BOTTOM OF WHICH HAD HESTER OR PEARL PEEPED INTO IT THEY MIGHT HAVE SEEN THE FROTHY REMNANT OF A RECENT DRAUGHT OF ALE
LITTLE PEARL WHO WAS AS GREATLY PLEASED WITH THE GLEAMING ARMOUR AS SHE HAD BEEN WITH THE GLITTERING FRONTISPIECE OF THE HOUSE SPENT SOME TIME LOOKING INTO THE POLISHED MIRROR OF THE BREASTPLATE
MOTHER CRIED SHE I SEE YOU HERE LOOK LOOK
IN TRUTH SHE SEEMED ABSOLUTELY HIDDEN BEHIND IT
PEARL ACCORDINGLY RAN TO THE BOW WINDOW AT THE FURTHER END OF THE HALL AND LOOKED ALONG THE VISTA OF A GARDEN WALK CARPETED WITH CLOSELY SHAVEN GRASS AND BORDERED WITH SOME RUDE AND IMMATURE ATTEMPT AT SHRUBBERY
BUT THE PROPRIETOR APPEARED ALREADY TO HAVE RELINQUISHED AS HOPELESS THE EFFORT TO PERPETUATE ON THIS SIDE OF THE ATLANTIC IN A HARD SOIL AND AMID THE CLOSE STRUGGLE FOR SUBSISTENCE THE NATIVE ENGLISH TASTE FOR ORNAMENTAL GARDENING
THERE WERE A FEW ROSE BUSHES HOWEVER AND A NUMBER OF APPLE TREES PROBABLY THE DESCENDANTS OF THOSE PLANTED BY THE REVEREND MISTER BLACKSTONE THE FIRST SETTLER OF THE PENINSULA THAT HALF MYTHOLOGICAL PERSONAGE WHO RIDES THROUGH OUR EARLY ANNALS SEATED ON THE BACK OF A BULL
PEARL SEEING THE ROSE BUSHES BEGAN TO CRY FOR A RED ROSE AND WOULD NOT BE PACIFIED
HOW STRANGE IT SEEMED TO THE SAD WOMAN AS SHE WATCHED THE GROWTH AND THE BEAUTY THAT BECAME EVERY DAY MORE BRILLIANT AND THE INTELLIGENCE THAT THREW ITS QUIVERING SUNSHINE OVER THE TINY FEATURES OF THIS CHILD
GOD AS A DIRECT CONSEQUENCE OF THE SIN WHICH MAN THUS PUNISHED HAD GIVEN HER A LOVELY CHILD WHOSE PLACE WAS ON THAT SAME DISHONOURED BOSOM TO CONNECT HER PARENT FOR EVER WITH THE RACE AND DESCENT OF MORTALS AND TO BE FINALLY A BLESSED SOUL IN HEAVEN
YET THESE THOUGHTS AFFECTED HESTER PRYNNE LESS WITH HOPE THAN APPREHENSION
THE CHILD HAD A NATIVE GRACE WHICH DOES NOT INVARIABLY CO EXIST WITH FAULTLESS BEAUTY ITS ATTIRE HOWEVER SIMPLE ALWAYS IMPRESSED THE BEHOLDER AS IF IT WERE THE VERY GARB THAT PRECISELY BECAME IT BEST
THIS OUTWARD MUTABILITY INDICATED AND DID NOT MORE THAN FAIRLY EXPRESS THE VARIOUS PROPERTIES OF HER INNER LIFE
HESTER COULD ONLY ACCOUNT FOR THE CHILD'S CHARACTER AND EVEN THEN MOST VAGUELY AND IMPERFECTLY BY RECALLING WHAT SHE HERSELF HAD BEEN DURING THAT MOMENTOUS PERIOD WHILE PEARL WAS IMBIBING HER SOUL FROM THE SPIRITUAL WORLD AND HER BODILY FRAME FROM ITS MATERIAL OF EARTH
THEY WERE NOW ILLUMINATED BY THE MORNING RADIANCE OF A YOUNG CHILD'S DISPOSITION BUT LATER IN THE DAY OF EARTHLY EXISTENCE MIGHT BE PROLIFIC OF THE STORM AND WHIRLWIND
HESTER PRYNNE NEVERTHELESS THE LOVING MOTHER OF THIS ONE CHILD RAN LITTLE RISK OF ERRING ON THE SIDE OF UNDUE SEVERITY
MINDFUL HOWEVER OF HER OWN ERRORS AND MISFORTUNES SHE EARLY SOUGHT TO IMPOSE A TENDER BUT STRICT CONTROL OVER THE INFANT IMMORTALITY THAT WAS COMMITTED TO HER CHARGE
AS TO ANY OTHER KIND OF DISCIPLINE WHETHER ADDRESSED TO HER MIND OR HEART LITTLE PEARL MIGHT OR MIGHT NOT BE WITHIN ITS REACH IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE CAPRICE THAT RULED THE MOMENT
IT WAS A LOOK SO INTELLIGENT YET INEXPLICABLE PERVERSE SOMETIMES SO MALICIOUS BUT GENERALLY ACCOMPANIED BY A WILD FLOW OF SPIRITS THAT HESTER COULD NOT HELP QUESTIONING AT SUCH MOMENTS WHETHER PEARL WAS A HUMAN CHILD
BEHOLDING IT HESTER WAS CONSTRAINED TO RUSH TOWARDS THE CHILD TO PURSUE THE LITTLE ELF IN THE FLIGHT WHICH SHE INVARIABLY BEGAN TO SNATCH HER TO HER BOSOM WITH A CLOSE PRESSURE AND EARNEST KISSES NOT SO MUCH FROM OVERFLOWING LOVE AS TO ASSURE HERSELF THAT PEARL WAS FLESH AND BLOOD AND NOT UTTERLY DELUSIVE
BROODING OVER ALL THESE MATTERS THE MOTHER FELT LIKE ONE WHO HAS EVOKED A SPIRIT BUT BY SOME IRREGULARITY IN THE PROCESS OF CONJURATION HAS FAILED TO WIN THE MASTER WORD THAT SHOULD CONTROL THIS NEW AND INCOMPREHENSIBLE INTELLIGENCE
PEARL WAS A BORN OUTCAST OF THE INFANTILE WORLD
PEARL SAW AND GAZED INTENTLY BUT NEVER SOUGHT TO MAKE ACQUAINTANCE
IF SPOKEN TO SHE WOULD NOT SPEAK AGAIN
TO FADE AWAY LIKE MORNING BEAUTY FROM HER MORTAL DAY DOWN BY THE RIVER OF ADONA HER SOFT VOICE IS HEARD AND THUS HER GENTLE LAMENTATION FALLS LIKE MORNING DEW
O LIFE OF THIS OUR SPRING
WHY FADES THE LOTUS OF THE WATER
WHY FADE THESE CHILDREN OF THE SPRING
THEL IS LIKE A WATRY BOW AND LIKE A PARTING CLOUD LIKE A REFLECTION IN A GLASS LIKE SHADOWS IN THE WATER LIKE DREAMS OF INFANTS LIKE A SMILE UPON AN INFANTS FACE
LIKE THE DOVES VOICE LIKE TRANSIENT DAY LIKE MUSIC IN THE AIR AH
AND GENTLE SLEEP THE SLEEP OF DEATH AND GENTLY HEAR THE VOICE OF HIM THAT WALKETH IN THE GARDEN IN THE EVENING TIME
THE LILLY OF THE VALLEY BREATHING IN THE HUMBLE GRASS ANSWERD THE LOVELY MAID AND SAID I AM A WATRY WEED AND I AM VERY SMALL AND LOVE TO DWELL IN LOWLY VALES SO WEAK THE GILDED BUTTERFLY SCARCE PERCHES ON MY HEAD YET I AM VISITED FROM HEAVEN AND HE THAT SMILES ON ALL WALKS IN THE VALLEY AND EACH MORN OVER ME SPREADS HIS HAND SAYING REJOICE THOU HUMBLE GRASS THOU NEW BORN LILY FLOWER
THOU GENTLE MAID OF SILENT VALLEYS AND OF MODEST BROOKS FOR THOU SHALL BE CLOTHED IN LIGHT AND FED WITH MORNING MANNA TILL SUMMERS HEAT MELTS THEE BESIDE THE FOUNTAINS AND THE SPRINGS TO FLOURISH IN ETERNAL VALES THEY WHY SHOULD THEL COMPLAIN
WHY SHOULD THE MISTRESS OF THE VALES OF HAR UTTER A SIGH
SHE CEASD AND SMILD IN TEARS THEN SAT DOWN IN HER SILVER SHRINE
WHICH THOU DOST SCATTER ON EVERY LITTLE BLADE OF GRASS THAT SPRINGS REVIVES THE MILKED COW AND TAMES THE FIRE BREATHING STEED
BUT THEL IS LIKE A FAINT CLOUD KINDLED AT THE RISING SUN I VANISH FROM MY PEARLY THRONE AND WHO SHALL FIND MY PLACE
AND WHY IT SCATTERS ITS BRIGHT BEAUTY THRO THE HUMID AIR
DESCEND O LITTLE CLOUD AND HOVER BEFORE THE EYES OF THEL
O LITTLE CLOUD THE VIRGIN SAID I CHARGE THEE TO TELL ME WHY THOU COMPLAINEST NOW WHEN IN ONE HOUR THOU FADE AWAY THEN WE SHALL SEEK THEE BUT NOT FIND AH THEL IS LIKE TO THEE
I PASS AWAY YET I COMPLAIN AND NO ONE HEARS MY VOICE
THE CLOUD THEN SHEWD HIS GOLDEN HEAD AND HIS BRIGHT FORM EMERG'D
AND FEAREST THOU BECAUSE I VANISH AND AM SEEN NO MORE
IT IS TO TENFOLD LIFE TO LOVE TO PEACE AND RAPTURES HOLY UNSEEN DESCENDING WEIGH MY LIGHT WINGS UPON BALMY FLOWERS AND COURT THE FAIR EYED DEW TO TAKE ME TO HER SHINING TENT THE WEEPING VIRGIN TREMBLING KNEELS BEFORE THE RISEN SUN
TILL WE ARISE LINK'D IN A GOLDEN BAND AND NEVER PART BUT WALK UNITED BEARING FOOD TO ALL OUR TENDER FLOWERS
LIVES NOT ALONE NOR OR ITSELF FEAR NOT AND I WILL CALL THE WEAK WORM FROM ITS LOWLY BED AND THOU SHALT HEAR ITS VOICE
COME FORTH WORM AND THE SILENT VALLEY TO THY PENSIVE QUEEN
THE HELPLESS WORM AROSE AND SAT UPON THE LILLYS LEAF AND THE BRIGHT CLOUD SAILD ON TO FIND HIS PARTNER IN THE VALE
IMAGE OF WEAKNESS ART THOU BUT A WORM
I SEE THEY LAY HELPLESS AND NAKED WEEPING AND NONE TO ANSWER NONE TO CHERISH THEE WITH MOTHERS SMILES
AND SAYS THOU MOTHER OF MY CHILDREN I HAVE LOVED THEE AND I HAVE GIVEN THEE A CROWN THAT NONE CAN TAKE AWAY
AND LAY ME DOWN IN THY COLD BED AND LEAVE MY SHINING LOT
OR AN EYE OF GIFTS AND GRACES SHOWRING FRUITS AND COINED GOLD
WHY A TONGUE IMPRESS'D WITH HONEY FROM EVERY WIND
WHY AN EAR A WHIRLPOOL FIERCE TO DRAW CREATIONS IN
ALL IS SAID WITHOUT A WORD
I SIT BENEATH THY LOOKS AS CHILDREN DO IN THE NOON SUN WITH SOULS THAT TREMBLE THROUGH THEIR HAPPY EYELIDS FROM AN UNAVERRED YET PRODIGAL INWARD JOY
I DID NOT WRONG MYSELF SO BUT I PLACED A WRONG ON THEE
WHEN CALLED BEFORE I TOLD HOW HASTILY I DROPPED MY FLOWERS OR BRAKE OFF FROM A GAME
SHALL I NEVER MISS HOME TALK AND BLESSING AND THE COMMON KISS THAT COMES TO EACH IN TURN NOR COUNT IT STRANGE WHEN I LOOK UP TO DROP ON A NEW RANGE OF WALLS AND FLOORS ANOTHER HOME THAN THIS
ALAS I HAVE GRIEVED SO I AM HARD TO LOVE
OPEN THY HEART WIDE AND FOLD WITHIN THE WET WINGS OF THY DOVE
COULD IT MEAN TO LAST A LOVE SET PENDULOUS BETWEEN SORROW AND SORROW
NAY I RATHER THRILLED DISTRUSTING EVERY LIGHT THAT SEEMED TO GILD THE ONWARD PATH AND FEARED TO OVERLEAN A FINGER EVEN
AND THOUGH I HAVE GROWN SERENE AND STRONG SINCE THEN I THINK THAT GOD HAS WILLED A STILL RENEWABLE FEAR
O LOVE O TROTH
AND LOVE BE FALSE
IF HE TO KEEP ONE OATH MUST LOSE ONE JOY BY HIS LIFE'S STAR FORETOLD
SLOW TO WORLD GREETINGS QUICK WITH ITS O LIST WHEN THE ANGELS SPEAK
A RING OF AMETHYST I COULD NOT WEAR HERE PLAINER TO MY SIGHT THAN THAT FIRST KISS
THAT WAS THE CHRISM OF LOVE WHICH LOVE'S OWN CROWN WITH SANCTIFYING SWEETNESS DID PRECEDE THE THIRD UPON MY LIPS WAS FOLDED DOWN IN PERFECT PURPLE STATE SINCE WHEN INDEED I HAVE BEEN PROUD AND SAID MY LOVE MY OWN
DEAREST TEACH ME SO TO POUR OUT GRATITUDE AS THOU DOST GOOD
MUSSULMANS AND GIAOURS THROW KERCHIEFS AT A SMILE AND HAVE NO RUTH FOR ANY WEEPING
BUT THOU ART NOT SUCH A LOVER MY BELOVED
THOU CANST WAIT THROUGH SORROW AND SICKNESS TO BRING SOULS TO TOUCH AND THINK IT SOON WHEN OTHERS CRY TOO LATE
I THANK ALL WHO HAVE LOVED ME IN THEIR HEARTS WITH THANKS AND LOVE FROM MINE
OH TO SHOOT MY SOUL'S FULL MEANING INTO FUTURE YEARS THAT THEY SHOULD LEND IT UTTERANCE AND SALUTE LOVE THAT ENDURES FROM LIFE THAT DISAPPEARS
THEN I LONG TRIED BY NATURAL ILLS RECEIVED THE COMFORT FAST WHILE BUDDING AT THY SIGHT MY PILGRIM'S STAFF GAVE OUT GREEN LEAVES WITH MORNING DEWS IMPEARLED
I LOVE THEE FREELY AS MEN STRIVE FOR RIGHT I LOVE THEE PURELY AS THEY TURN FROM PRAISE
I LOVE THEE WITH THE PASSION PUT TO USE IN MY OLD GRIEFS AND WITH MY CHILDHOOD'S FAITH
I LOVE THEE WITH A LOVE I SEEMED TO LOSE WITH MY LOST SAINTS I LOVE THEE WITH THE BREATH SMILES TEARS OF ALL MY LIFE AND IF GOD CHOOSE I SHALL BUT LOVE THEE BETTER AFTER DEATH
NATURE OF THE EFFECT PRODUCED BY EARLY IMPRESSIONS
THAT IS COMPARATIVELY NOTHING
THEY ARE CHIEFLY FORMED FROM COMBINATIONS OF THE IMPRESSIONS MADE IN CHILDHOOD
VAST IMPORTANCE AND INFLUENCE OF THIS MENTAL FURNISHING
WITHOUT GOING TO ANY SUCH EXTREME AS THIS WE CAN EASILY SEE ON REFLECTION HOW VAST AN INFLUENCE ON THE IDEAS AND CONCEPTIONS AS WELL AS ON THE PRINCIPLES OF ACTION IN MATURE YEARS MUST BE EXERTED BY THE NATURE AND CHARACTER OF THE IMAGES WHICH THE PERIOD OF INFANCY AND CHILDHOOD IMPRESSES UPON THE MIND
THE PAIN PRODUCED BY AN ACT OF HASTY AND ANGRY VIOLENCE TO WHICH A FATHER SUBJECTS HIS SON MAY SOON PASS AWAY BUT THE MEMORY OF IT DOES NOT PASS AWAY WITH THE PAIN
TO SUCH PERSONS THESE INDIRECT MODES OF TRAINING CHILDREN IN HABITS OF SUBORDINATION TO THEIR WILL OR RATHER OF YIELDING TO THEIR INFLUENCE ARE SPECIALLY USEFUL
DELLA HAD A YOUNG SISTER NAMED MARIA AND A COUSIN WHOSE NAME WAS JANE
NOW DELIA CONTRIVED TO OBTAIN A GREAT INFLUENCE AND ASCENDENCY OVER THE MINDS OF THE CHILDREN BY MEANS OF THESE DOLLS
TO GIVE AN IDEA OF THESE CONVERSATIONS I WILL REPORT ONE OF THEM IN FULL
YOU HAVE COME ANDELLA ANDELLA WAS THE NAME OF JANE'S DOLL TO MAKE ROSALIE A VISIT
I AM VERY GLAD
I EXPECT YOU HAVE BEEN A VERY GOOD GIRL ANDELLA SINCE YOU WERE HERE LAST
THEN TURNING TO JANE SHE ASKED IN A SOMEWHAT ALTERED TONE HAS SHE BEEN A GOOD GIRL JANE
FOR INSTANCE ONE DAY THE CHILDREN HAD BEEN PLAYING UPON THE PIAZZA WITH BLOCKS AND OTHER PLAYTHINGS AND FINALLY HAD GONE INTO THE HOUSE LEAVING ALL THE THINGS ON THE FLOOR OF THE PIAZZA INSTEAD OF PUTTING THEM AWAY IN THEIR PLACES AS THEY OUGHT TO HAVE DONE
THEY WERE NOW PLAYING WITH THEIR DOLLS IN THE PARLOR
DELIA CAME TO THE PARLOR AND WITH AN AIR OF GREAT MYSTERY BECKONED THE CHILDREN ASIDE AND SAID TO THEM IN A WHISPER LEAVE ANDELLA AND ROSALIE HERE AND DON'T SAY A WORD TO THEM
SO SAYING SHE LED THE WAY ON TIPTOE FOLLOWED BY THE CHILDREN OUT OF THE ROOM AND ROUND BY A CIRCUITOUS ROUTE TO THE PIAZZA THERE
SAID SHE POINTING TO THE PLAYTHINGS SEE
PUT THESE PLAYTHINGS ALL AWAY QUICK AND CAREFULLY AND WE WILL NOT LET THEM KNOW ANY THING ABOUT YOUR LEAVING THEM OUT
AND THIS METHOD OF TREATING THE CASE WAS MUCH MORE EFFECTUAL IN MAKING THEM DISPOSED TO AVOID COMMITTING A SIMILAR FAULT ANOTHER TIME THAN ANY DIRECT REBUKES OR EXPRESSIONS OF DISPLEASURE ADDRESSED PERSONALLY TO THEM WOULD HAVE BEEN
THE THREE MODES OF MANAGEMENT
TO SUPPOSE THAT THE OBJECT OF THIS WORK IS TO AID IN EFFECTING SUCH A SUBSTITUTION AS THAT IS ENTIRELY TO MISTAKE ITS NATURE AND DESIGN
BY REASON AND AFFECTION
AS THE CHAISE DRIVES AWAY MARY STANDS BEWILDERED AND PERPLEXED ON THE DOOR STEP HER MIND IN A TUMULT OF EXCITEMENT IN WHICH HATRED OF THE DOCTOR DISTRUST AND SUSPICION OF HER MOTHER DISAPPOINTMENT VEXATION AND ILL HUMOR SURGE AND SWELL AMONG THOSE DELICATE ORGANIZATIONS ON WHICH THE STRUCTURE AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUL SO CLOSELY DEPEND DOING PERHAPS AN IRREPARABLE INJURY
THE MOTHER AS SOON AS THE CHAISE IS SO FAR TURNED THAT MARY CAN NO LONGER WATCH THE EXPRESSION OF HER COUNTENANCE GOES AWAY FROM THE DOOR WITH A SMILE OF COMPLACENCY AND SATISFACTION UPON HER FACE AT THE INGENUITY AND SUCCESS OF HER LITTLE ARTIFICE
SO YOU WILL BE A GOOD GIRL I KNOW AND NOT MAKE ANY TROUBLE BUT WILL STAY AT HOME CONTENTEDLY WON'T YOU
THE MOTHER IN MANAGING THE CASE IN THIS WAY RELIES PARTLY ON CONVINCING THE REASON OF THE CHILD AND PARTLY ON AN APPEAL TO HER AFFECTION
IF YOU SHOULD NOT BE A GOOD GIRL BUT SHOULD SHOW SIGNS OF MAKING US ANY TROUBLE I SHALL HAVE TO SEND YOU OUT SOMEWHERE TO THE BACK PART OF THE HOUSE UNTIL WE ARE GONE
BUT THIS LAST SUPPOSITION IS ALMOST ALWAYS UNNECESSARY FOR IF MARY HAS BEEN HABITUALLY MANAGED ON THIS PRINCIPLE SHE WILL NOT MAKE ANY TROUBLE
IT IS INDEED TRUE THAT THE IMPORTANCE OF TACT AND SKILL IN THE TRAINING OF THE YOUNG AND OF CULTIVATING THEIR REASON AND SECURING THEIR AFFECTION CAN NOT BE OVERRATED
BUT ANDERS CARED NOTHING ABOUT THAT
HE MADE A BOW SO DEEP THAT HIS BACK CAME NEAR BREAKING AND HE WAS DUMBFOUNDED I CAN TELL YOU WHEN HE SAW IT WAS NOBODY BUT ANDERS
HE WAS SUCH A BIG BOY THAT HE WORE HIGH BOOTS AND CARRIED A JACK KNIFE
NOW THIS KNIFE WAS A SPLENDID ONE THOUGH HALF THE BLADE WAS GONE AND THE HANDLE WAS A LITTLE CRACKED AND ANDERS KNEW THAT ONE IS ALMOST A MAN AS SOON AS ONE HAS A JACK KNIFE
YES WHY NOT THOUGHT ANDERS
SEEING THAT I AM SO FINE I MAY AS WELL GO AND VISIT THE KING
I AM GOING TO THE COURT BALL ANSWERED ANDERS
AND SHE TOOK ANDERS HAND AND WALKED WITH HIM UP THE BROAD MARBLE STAIRS WHERE SOLDIERS WERE POSTED AT EVERY THIRD STEP AND THROUGH THE MAGNIFICENT HALLS WHERE COURTIERS IN SILK AND VELVET STOOD BOWING WHEREVER HE WENT
FOR LIKE AS NOT THEY MUST HAVE THOUGHT HIM A PRINCE WHEN THEY SAW HIS FINE CAP
AT THE FARTHER END OF THE LARGEST HALL A TABLE WAS SET WITH GOLDEN CUPS AND GOLDEN PLATES IN LONG ROWS
ON HUGE SILVER PLATTERS WERE PYRAMIDS OF TARTS AND CAKES AND RED WINE SPARKLED IN GLITTERING DECANTERS
THE PRINCESS SAT DOWN UNDER A BLUE CANOPY WITH BOUQUETS OF ROSES AND SHE LET ANDERS SIT IN A GOLDEN CHAIR BY HER SIDE
BUT YOU MUST NOT EAT WITH YOUR CAP ON YOUR HEAD SHE SAID AND WAS GOING TO TAKE IT OFF
THE PRINCESS CERTAINLY WAS BEAUTIFUL AND HE WOULD HAVE DEARLY LIKED TO BE KISSED BY HER BUT THE CAP WHICH HIS MOTHER HAD MADE HE WOULD NOT GIVE UP ON ANY CONDITION
HE ONLY SHOOK HIS HEAD
WELL BUT NOW SAID THE PRINCESS AND SHE FILLED HIS POCKETS WITH CAKES AND PUT HER OWN HEAVY GOLD CHAIN AROUND HIS NECK AND BENT DOWN AND KISSED HIM
THAT IS A VERY FINE CAP YOU HAVE HE SAID
SO IT IS SAID ANDERS
AND IT IS MADE OF MOTHER'S BEST YARN AND SHE KNITTED IT HERSELF AND EVERYBODY WANTS TO GET IT AWAY FROM ME
WITH ONE JUMP ANDERS GOT OUT OF HIS CHAIR
HE DARTED LIKE AN ARROW THROUGH ALL THE HALLS DOWN ALL THE STAIRS AND ACROSS THE YARD
HE STILL HELD ON TO IT WITH BOTH HANDS AS HE RUSHED INTO HIS MOTHER'S COTTAGE
AND ALL HIS BROTHERS AND SISTERS STOOD ROUND AND LISTENED WITH THEIR MOUTHS OPEN
BUT WHEN HIS BIG BROTHER HEARD THAT HE HAD REFUSED TO GIVE HIS CAP FOR A KING'S GOLDEN CROWN HE SAID THAT ANDERS WAS A STUPID
ANDERS FACE GREW RED
BUT HIS MOTHER HUGGED HIM CLOSE
NO MY LITTLE SON SHE SAID
IF YOU DRESSED IN SILK AND GOLD FROM TOP TO TOE YOU COULD NOT LOOK ANY NICER THAN IN YOUR LITTLE RED CAP
HE PASSED THROUGH HENLEY SAINT ALBANS AND CAME SO NEAR TO LONDON AS HARROW ON THE HILL
THE SCOTTISH GENERALS AND COMMISSIONERS AFFECTED GREAT SURPRISE ON THE APPEARANCE OF THE KING AND THOUGH THEY PAID HIM ALL THE EXTERIOR RESPECT DUE TO HIS DIGNITY THEY INSTANTLY SET A GUARD UPON HIM UNDER COLOR OF PROTECTION AND MADE HIM IN REALITY A PRISONER
THEY INFORMED THE ENGLISH PARLIAMENT OF THIS UNEXPECTED INCIDENT AND ASSURED THEM THAT THEY HAD ENTERED INTO NO PRIVATE TREATY WITH THE KING
OR HATH HE GIVEN US ANY GIFT
AND THE MEN OF ISRAEL ANSWERED THE MEN OF JUDAH AND SAID WE HAVE TEN PARTS IN THE KING AND WE HAVE ALSO MORE RIGHT IN DAVID THAN YE WHY THEN DID YE DESPISE US THAT OUR ADVICE SHOULD NOT BE FIRST HAD IN BRINGING BACK OUR KING
ANOTHER PREACHER AFTER REPROACHING HIM TO HIS FACE WITH HIS MISGOVERNMENT ORDERED THIS PSALM TO BE SUNG
THE KING STOOD UP AND CALLED FOR THAT PSALM WHICH BEGINS WITH THESE WORDS
HAVE MERCY LORD ON ME I PRAY FOR MEN WOULD ME DEVOUR
THE GOOD NATURED AUDIENCE IN PITY TO FALLEN MAJESTY SHOWED FOR ONCE GREATER DEFERENCE TO THE KING THAN TO THE MINISTER AND SUNG THE PSALM WHICH THE FORMER HAD CALLED FOR
THE PARLIAMENT AND THE SCOTS LAID THEIR PROPOSALS BEFORE THE KING
BEFORE THE SETTLEMENT OF TERMS THE ADMINISTRATION MUST BE POSSESSED ENTIRELY BY THE PARLIAMENTS OF BOTH KINGDOMS AND HOW INCOMPATIBLE THAT SCHEME WITH THE LIBERTY OF THE KING IS EASILY IMAGINED
THE ENGLISH IT IS EVIDENT HAD THEY NOT BEEN PREVIOUSLY ASSURED OF RECEIVING THE KING WOULD NEVER HAVE PARTED WITH SO CONSIDERABLE A SUM AND WHILE THEY WEAKENED THEMSELVES BY THE SAME MEASURE HAVE STRENGTHENED A PEOPLE WITH WHOM THEY MUST AFTERWARDS HAVE SO MATERIAL AN INTEREST TO DISCUSS
IF ANY STILL RETAINED RANCOR AGAINST HIM IN HIS PRESENT CONDITION THEY PASSED IN SILENCE WHILE HIS WELL WISHERS MORE GENEROUS THAN PRUDENT ACCOMPANIED HIS MARCH WITH TEARS WITH ACCLAMATIONS AND WITH PRAYERS FOR HIS SAFETY
HIS DEATH IN THIS CONJUNCTURE WAS A PUBLIC MISFORTUNE
THOUGH THROWN INTO PRISON FOR THIS ENTERPRISE AND DETAINED SOME TIME HE WAS NOT DISCOURAGED BUT STILL CONTINUED BY HIS COUNTENANCE AND PROTECTION TO INFUSE SPIRIT INTO THE DISTRESSED ROYALISTS
AMONG OTHER PERSONS OF DISTINCTION WHO UNITED THEMSELVES TO HIM WAS LORD NAPIER OF MERCHISTON SON OF THE FAMOUS INVENTOR OF THE LOGARITHMS THE PERSON TO WHOM THE TITLE OF A GREAT MAN IS MORE JUSTLY DUE THAN TO ANY OTHER WHOM HIS COUNTRY EVER PRODUCED
WHILE THE FORMER FORETOLD THAT THE SCOTTISH COVENANTERS WERE SECRETLY FORMING A UNION WITH THE ENGLISH PARLIAMENT AND INCULCATED THE NECESSITY OF PREVENTING THEM BY SOME VIGOROUS UNDERTAKING THE LATTER STILL INSISTED THAT EVERY SUCH ATTEMPT WOULD PRECIPITATE THEM INTO MEASURES TO WHICH OTHERWISE THEY WERE NOT PERHAPS INCLINED
THE KING'S EARS WERE NOW OPEN TO MONTROSE'S COUNSELS WHO PROPOSED NONE BUT THE BOLDEST AND MOST DARING AGREEABLY TO THE DESPERATE STATE OF THE ROYAL CAUSE IN SCOTLAND
FIVE HUNDRED MEN MORE WHO HAD BEEN LEVIED BY THE COVENANTERS WERE PERSUADED TO EMBRACE THE ROYAL CAUSE AND WITH THIS COMBINED FORCE HE HASTENED TO ATTACK LORD ELCHO WHO LAY AT PERTH WITH AN ARMY OF SIX THOUSAND MEN ASSEMBLED UPON THE FIRST NEWS OF THE IRISH INVASION
DREADING THE SUPERIOR POWER OF ARGYLE WHO HAVING JOINED HIS VASSALS TO A FORCE LEVIED BY THE PUBLIC WAS APPROACHING WITH A CONSIDERABLE ARMY MONTROSE HASTENED NORTHWARDS IN ORDER TO ROUSE AGAIN THE MARQUIS OF HUNTLEY AND THE GORDONS WHO HAVING BEFORE HASTILY TAKEN ARMS HAD BEEN INSTANTLY SUPPRESSED BY THE COVENANTERS
THIS NOBLEMAN'S CHARACTER THOUGH CELEBRATED FOR POLITICAL COURAGE AND CONDUCT WAS VERY LOW FOR MILITARY PROWESS AND AFTER SOME SKIRMISHES IN WHICH HE WAS WORSTED HE HERE ALLOWED MONTROSE TO ESCAPE HIM
BY QUICK MARCHES THROUGH THESE INACCESSIBLE MOUNTAINS THAT GENERAL FREED HIMSELF FROM THE SUPERIOR FORCES OF THE COVENANTERS
WITH THESE AND SOME REENFORCEMENTS OF THE ATHOLEMEN AND MACDONALDS WHOM HE HAD RECALLED MONTROSE FELL SUDDENLY UPON ARGYLE'S COUNTRY AND LET LOOSE UPON IT ALL THE RAGE OF WAR CARRYING OFF THE CATTLE BURNING THE HOUSES AND PUTTING THE INHABITANTS TO THE SWORD
THIS SEVERITY BY WHICH MONTROSE SULLIED HIS VICTORIES WAS THE RESULT OF PRIVATE ANIMOSITY AGAINST THE CHIEFTAIN AS MUCH AS OF ZEAL FOR THE PUBLIC CAUSE ARGYLE COLLECTING THREE THOUSAND MEN MARCHED IN QUEST OF THE ENEMY WHO HAD RETIRED WITH THEIR PLUNDER AND HE LAY AT INNERLOCHY SUPPOSING HIMSELF STILL AT A CONSIDERABLE DISTANCE FROM THEM
BY A QUICK AND UNEXPECTED MARCH MONTROSE HASTENED TO INNERLOCHY AND PRESENTED HIMSELF IN ORDER OF BATTLE BEFORE THE SURPRISED BUT NOT AFFRIGHTENED COVENANTERS
HIS CONDUCT AND PRESENCE OF MIND IN THIS EMERGENCE APPEARED CONSPICUOUS
MONTROSE WEAK IN CAVALRY HERE LINED HIS TROOPS OF HORSE WITH INFANTRY AND AFTER PUTTING THE ENEMY'S HORSE TO ROUT FELL WITH UNITED FORCE UPON THEIR FOOT WHO WERE ENTIRELY CUT IN PIECES THOUGH WITH THE LOSS OF THE GALLANT LORD GORDON ON THE PART OF THE ROYALISTS
FROM THE SAME MEN NEW REGIMENTS AND NEW COMPANIES WERE FORMED DIFFERENT OFFICERS APPOINTED AND THE WHOLE MILITARY FORCE PUT INTO SUCH HANDS AS THE INDEPENDENTS COULD RELY ON
BESIDES MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT WHO WERE EXCLUDED MANY OFFICERS UNWILLING TO SERVE UNDER THE NEW GENERALS THREW UP THEIR COMMISSIONS AND UNWARILY FACILITATED THE PROJECT OF PUTTING THE ARMY ENTIRELY INTO THE HANDS OF THAT FACTION
THOUGH THE DISCIPLINE OF THE FORMER PARLIAMENTARY ARMY WAS NOT CONTEMPTIBLE A MORE EXACT PLAN WAS INTRODUCED AND RIGOROUSLY EXECUTED BY THESE NEW COMMANDERS
VALOR INDEED WAS VERY GENERALLY DIFFUSED OVER THE ONE PARTY AS WELL AS THE OTHER DURING THIS PERIOD DISCIPLINE ALSO WAS ATTAINED BY THE FORCES OF THE PARLIAMENT BUT THE PERFECTION OF THE MILITARY ART IN CONCERTING THE GENERAL PLANS OF ACTION AND THE OPERATIONS OF THE FIELD SEEMS STILL ON BOTH SIDES TO HAVE BEEN IN A GREAT MEASURE WANTING
HISTORIANS AT LEAST PERHAPS FROM THEIR OWN IGNORANCE AND INEXPERIENCE HAVE NOT REMARKED ANY THING BUT A HEADLONG IMPETUOUS CONDUCT EACH PARTY HURRYING TO A BATTLE WHERE VALOR AND FORTUNE CHIEFLY DETERMINED THE SUCCESS
CHAPTER ONE ORIGIN
IT ENGENDERS A WHOLE WORLD LA PEGRE FOR WHICH READ THEFT AND A HELL LA PEGRENNE FOR WHICH READ HUNGER
THUS IDLENESS IS THE MOTHER
SHE HAS A SON THEFT AND A DAUGHTER HUNGER
WHAT IS SLANG
WE HAVE NEVER UNDERSTOOD THIS SORT OF OBJECTIONS
SLANG IS ODIOUS
SLANG MAKES ONE SHUDDER
WHO DENIES THAT OF COURSE IT DOES
WHEN IT IS A QUESTION OF PROBING A WOUND A GULF A SOCIETY SINCE WHEN HAS IT BEEN CONSIDERED WRONG TO GO TOO FAR TO GO TO THE BOTTOM
WE HAVE ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT IT WAS SOMETIMES A COURAGEOUS ACT AND AT LEAST A SIMPLE AND USEFUL DEED WORTHY OF THE SYMPATHETIC ATTENTION WHICH DUTY ACCEPTED AND FULFILLED MERITS
WHY SHOULD ONE NOT EXPLORE EVERYTHING AND STUDY EVERYTHING
WHY SHOULD ONE HALT ON THE WAY
NOTHING IS MORE LUGUBRIOUS THAN THE CONTEMPLATION THUS IN ITS NUDITY IN THE BROAD LIGHT OF THOUGHT OF THE HORRIBLE SWARMING OF SLANG
NOW WHEN HAS HORROR EVER EXCLUDED STUDY
SINCE WHEN HAS MALADY BANISHED MEDICINE
CAN ONE IMAGINE A NATURALIST REFUSING TO STUDY THE VIPER THE BAT THE SCORPION THE CENTIPEDE THE TARANTULA AND ONE WHO WOULD CAST THEM BACK INTO THEIR DARKNESS SAYING OH HOW UGLY THAT IS
HE WOULD BE LIKE A PHILOLOGIST REFUSING TO EXAMINE A FACT IN LANGUAGE A PHILOSOPHER HESITATING TO SCRUTINIZE A FACT IN HUMANITY
WHAT IS SLANG PROPERLY SPEAKING
IT IS THE LANGUAGE OF WRETCHEDNESS
WE MAY BE STOPPED THE FACT MAY BE PUT TO US IN GENERAL TERMS WHICH IS ONE WAY OF ATTENUATING IT WE MAY BE TOLD THAT ALL TRADES PROFESSIONS IT MAY BE ADDED ALL THE ACCIDENTS OF THE SOCIAL HIERARCHY AND ALL FORMS OF INTELLIGENCE HAVE THEIR OWN SLANG
THE PAINTER WHO SAYS MY GRINDER THE NOTARY WHO SAYS MY SKIP THE GUTTER THE HAIRDRESSER WHO SAYS MY MEALYBACK THE COBBLER WHO SAYS MY CUB TALKS SLANG
THERE IS THE SLANG OF THE AFFECTED LADY AS WELL AS OF THE PRECIEUSES
THE SUGAR MANUFACTURER WHO SAYS LOAF CLARIFIED LUMPS BASTARD COMMON BURNT THIS HONEST MANUFACTURER TALKS SLANG
ALGEBRA MEDICINE BOTANY HAVE EACH THEIR SLANG
TO MEET THE NEEDS OF THIS CONFLICT WRETCHEDNESS HAS INVENTED A LANGUAGE OF COMBAT WHICH IS SLANG
TO KEEP AFLOAT AND TO RESCUE FROM OBLIVION TO HOLD ABOVE THE GULF WERE IT BUT A FRAGMENT OF SOME LANGUAGE WHICH MAN HAS SPOKEN AND WHICH WOULD OTHERWISE BE LOST THAT IS TO SAY ONE OF THE ELEMENTS GOOD OR BAD OF WHICH CIVILIZATION IS COMPOSED OR BY WHICH IT IS COMPLICATED TO EXTEND THE RECORDS OF SOCIAL OBSERVATION IS TO SERVE CIVILIZATION ITSELF
PHOENICIAN VERY GOOD
EVEN DIALECT LET THAT PASS
TO THIS WE REPLY IN ONE WORD ONLY
ASSUREDLY IF THE TONGUE WHICH A NATION OR A PROVINCE HAS SPOKEN IS WORTHY OF INTEREST THE LANGUAGE WHICH HAS BEEN SPOKEN BY A MISERY IS STILL MORE WORTHY OF ATTENTION AND STUDY
AND THEN WE INSIST UPON IT THE STUDY OF SOCIAL DEFORMITIES AND INFIRMITIES AND THE TASK OF POINTING THEM OUT WITH A VIEW TO REMEDY IS NOT A BUSINESS IN WHICH CHOICE IS PERMITTED
HE MUST DESCEND WITH HIS HEART FULL OF CHARITY AND SEVERITY AT THE SAME TIME AS A BROTHER AND AS A JUDGE TO THOSE IMPENETRABLE CASEMATES WHERE CRAWL PELL MELL THOSE WHO BLEED AND THOSE WHO DEAL THE BLOW THOSE WHO WEEP AND THOSE WHO CURSE THOSE WHO FAST AND THOSE WHO DEVOUR THOSE WHO ENDURE EVIL AND THOSE WHO INFLICT IT
DO WE REALLY KNOW THE MOUNTAIN WELL WHEN WE ARE NOT ACQUAINTED WITH THE CAVERN
THEY CONSTITUTE TWO DIFFERENT ORDERS OF FACTS WHICH CORRESPOND TO EACH OTHER WHICH ARE ALWAYS INTERLACED AND WHICH OFTEN BRING FORTH RESULTS
TRUE HISTORY BEING A MIXTURE OF ALL THINGS THE TRUE HISTORIAN MINGLES IN EVERYTHING
FACTS FORM ONE OF THESE AND IDEAS THE OTHER
THERE IT CLOTHES ITSELF IN WORD MASKS IN METAPHOR RAGS
IN THIS GUISE IT BECOMES HORRIBLE
ONE PERCEIVES WITHOUT UNDERSTANDING IT A HIDEOUS MURMUR SOUNDING ALMOST LIKE HUMAN ACCENTS BUT MORE NEARLY RESEMBLING A HOWL THAN AN ARTICULATE WORD
ONE THINKS ONE HEARS HYDRAS TALKING
IT IS UNINTELLIGIBLE IN THE DARK
IT IS BLACK IN MISFORTUNE IT IS BLACKER STILL IN CRIME THESE TWO BLACKNESSES AMALGAMATED COMPOSE SLANG
THE EARTH IS NOT DEVOID OF RESEMBLANCE TO A JAIL
LOOK CLOSELY AT LIFE
IT IS SO MADE THAT EVERYWHERE WE FEEL THE SENSE OF PUNISHMENT
EACH DAY HAS ITS OWN GREAT GRIEF OR ITS LITTLE CARE
YESTERDAY YOU WERE TREMBLING FOR A HEALTH THAT IS DEAR TO YOU TO DAY YOU FEAR FOR YOUR OWN TO MORROW IT WILL BE ANXIETY ABOUT MONEY THE DAY AFTER TO MORROW THE DIATRIBE OF A SLANDERER THE DAY AFTER THAT THE MISFORTUNE OF SOME FRIEND THEN THE PREVAILING WEATHER THEN SOMETHING THAT HAS BEEN BROKEN OR LOST THEN A PLEASURE WITH WHICH YOUR CONSCIENCE AND YOUR VERTEBRAL COLUMN REPROACH YOU AGAIN THE COURSE OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS
THIS WITHOUT RECKONING IN THE PAINS OF THE HEART AND SO IT GOES ON
THERE IS HARDLY ONE DAY OUT OF A HUNDRED WHICH IS WHOLLY JOYOUS AND SUNNY
AND YOU BELONG TO THAT SMALL CLASS WHO ARE HAPPY
IN THIS WORLD EVIDENTLY THE VESTIBULE OF ANOTHER THERE ARE NO FORTUNATE
THE REAL HUMAN DIVISION IS THIS THE LUMINOUS AND THE SHADY
TO DIMINISH THE NUMBER OF THE SHADY TO AUGMENT THE NUMBER OF THE LUMINOUS THAT IS THE OBJECT
THAT IS WHY WE CRY EDUCATION SCIENCE
TO TEACH READING MEANS TO LIGHT THE FIRE EVERY SYLLABLE SPELLED OUT SPARKLES
HOWEVER HE WHO SAYS LIGHT DOES NOT NECESSARILY SAY JOY
PEOPLE SUFFER IN THE LIGHT EXCESS BURNS
THE FLAME IS THE ENEMY OF THE WING
TO BURN WITHOUT CEASING TO FLY THEREIN LIES THE MARVEL OF GENIUS
OUT IN THE WOODS STOOD A NICE LITTLE FIR TREE
THE PLACE HE HAD WAS A VERY GOOD ONE THE SUN SHONE ON HIM AS TO FRESH AIR THERE WAS ENOUGH OF THAT AND ROUND HIM GREW MANY LARGE SIZED COMRADES PINES AS WELL AS FIRS
HE DID NOT THINK OF THE WARM SUN AND OF THE FRESH AIR HE DID NOT CARE FOR THE LITTLE COTTAGE CHILDREN THAT RAN ABOUT AND PRATTLED WHEN THEY WERE IN THE WOODS LOOKING FOR WILD STRAWBERRIES
BUT THIS WAS WHAT THE TREE COULD NOT BEAR TO HEAR
IN WINTER WHEN THE SNOW LAY GLITTERING ON THE GROUND A HARE WOULD OFTEN COME LEAPING ALONG AND JUMP RIGHT OVER THE LITTLE TREE
OH THAT MADE HIM SO ANGRY
TO GROW AND GROW TO GET OLDER AND BE TALL THOUGHT THE TREE THAT AFTER ALL IS THE MOST DELIGHTFUL THING IN THE WORLD
IN AUTUMN THE WOOD CUTTERS ALWAYS CAME AND FELLED SOME OF THE LARGEST TREES
THIS HAPPENED EVERY YEAR AND THE YOUNG FIR TREE THAT HAD NOW GROWN TO A VERY COMELY SIZE TREMBLED AT THE SIGHT FOR THE MAGNIFICENT GREAT TREES FELL TO THE EARTH WITH NOISE AND CRACKING THE BRANCHES WERE LOPPED OFF AND THE TREES LOOKED LONG AND BARE THEY WERE HARDLY TO BE RECOGNISED AND THEN THEY WERE LAID IN CARTS AND THE HORSES DRAGGED THEM OUT OF THE WOOD
HAVE YOU NOT MET THEM ANYWHERE
REJOICE IN THY GROWTH SAID THE SUNBEAMS
AND THEN WHAT HAPPENS THEN
I WOULD FAIN KNOW IF I AM DESTINED FOR SO GLORIOUS A CAREER CRIED THE TREE REJOICING
I AM NOW TALL AND MY BRANCHES SPREAD LIKE THE OTHERS THAT WERE CARRIED OFF LAST YEAR OH
WERE I BUT ALREADY ON THE CART
WERE I IN THE WARM ROOM WITH ALL THE SPLENDOR AND MAGNIFICENCE
YES THEN SOMETHING BETTER SOMETHING STILL GRANDER WILL SURELY FOLLOW OR WHEREFORE SHOULD THEY THUS ORNAMENT ME
SOMETHING BETTER SOMETHING STILL GRANDER MUST FOLLOW BUT WHAT
REJOICE IN OUR PRESENCE SAID THE AIR AND THE SUNLIGHT
REJOICE IN THY OWN FRESH YOUTH
BUT THE TREE DID NOT REJOICE AT ALL HE GREW AND GREW AND WAS GREEN BOTH WINTER AND SUMMER
AND TOWARDS CHRISTMAS HE WAS ONE OF THE FIRST THAT WAS CUT DOWN
THE AXE STRUCK DEEP INTO THE VERY PITH THE TREE FELL TO THE EARTH WITH A SIGH HE FELT A PANG IT WAS LIKE A SWOON HE COULD NOT THINK OF HAPPINESS FOR HE WAS SORROWFUL AT BEING SEPARATED FROM HIS HOME FROM THE PLACE WHERE HE HAD SPRUNG UP
HE WELL KNEW THAT HE SHOULD NEVER SEE HIS DEAR OLD COMRADES THE LITTLE BUSHES AND FLOWERS AROUND HIM ANYMORE PERHAPS NOT EVEN THE BIRDS
THE DEPARTURE WAS NOT AT ALL AGREEABLE
THE TREE ONLY CAME TO HIMSELF WHEN HE WAS UNLOADED IN A COURT YARD WITH THE OTHER TREES AND HEARD A MAN SAY THAT ONE IS SPLENDID WE DON'T WANT THE OTHERS
THERE TOO WERE LARGE EASY CHAIRS SILKEN SOFAS LARGE TABLES FULL OF PICTURE BOOKS AND FULL OF TOYS WORTH HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF CROWNS AT LEAST THE CHILDREN SAID SO
THE SERVANTS AS WELL AS THE YOUNG LADIES DECORATED IT
THIS EVENING THEY ALL SAID
HOW IT WILL SHINE THIS EVENING
PERHAPS THE OTHER TREES FROM THE FOREST WILL COME TO LOOK AT ME
IT BLAZED UP FAMOUSLY HELP HELP
CRIED THE YOUNG LADIES AND THEY QUICKLY PUT OUT THE FIRE
A STORY
A STORY CRIED THE CHILDREN DRAWING A LITTLE FAT MAN TOWARDS THE TREE
BUT I SHALL TELL ONLY ONE STORY
HUMPY DUMPY FELL DOWNSTAIRS AND YET HE MARRIED THE PRINCESS
THAT'S THE WAY OF THE WORLD
THOUGHT THE FIR TREE AND BELIEVED IT ALL BECAUSE THE MAN WHO TOLD THE STORY WAS SO GOOD LOOKING WELL WELL
I WON'T TREMBLE TO MORROW THOUGHT THE FIR TREE
AND THE WHOLE NIGHT THE TREE STOOD STILL AND IN DEEP THOUGHT
IN THE MORNING THE SERVANT AND THE HOUSEMAID CAME IN
BUT THEY DRAGGED HIM OUT OF THE ROOM AND UP THE STAIRS INTO THE LOFT AND HERE IN A DARK CORNER WHERE NO DAYLIGHT COULD ENTER THEY LEFT HIM
WHAT'S THE MEANING OF THIS THOUGHT THE TREE
AND HE LEANED AGAINST THE WALL LOST IN REVERIE
TIME ENOUGH HAD HE TOO FOR HIS REFLECTIONS FOR DAYS AND NIGHTS PASSED ON AND NOBODY CAME UP AND WHEN AT LAST SOMEBODY DID COME IT WAS ONLY TO PUT SOME GREAT TRUNKS IN A CORNER OUT OF THE WAY
TIS NOW WINTER OUT OF DOORS THOUGHT THE TREE
HOW KIND MAN IS AFTER ALL
IF IT ONLY WERE NOT SO DARK HERE AND SO TERRIBLY LONELY
SQUEAK SQUEAK
THEY SNUFFED ABOUT THE FIR TREE AND RUSTLED AMONG THE BRANCHES
I AM BY NO MEANS OLD SAID THE FIR TREE
THERE'S MANY A ONE CONSIDERABLY OLDER THAN I AM
THEY WERE SO EXTREMELY CURIOUS
I KNOW NO SUCH PLACE SAID THE TREE
AND THEN HE TOLD ALL ABOUT HIS YOUTH AND THE LITTLE MICE HAD NEVER HEARD THE LIKE BEFORE AND THEY LISTENED AND SAID
SAID THE FIR TREE THINKING OVER WHAT HE HAD HIMSELF RELATED
YES IN REALITY THOSE WERE HAPPY TIMES
WHO IS HUMPY DUMPY ASKED THE MICE
ONLY THAT ONE ANSWERED THE TREE
IT IS A VERY STUPID STORY
DON'T YOU KNOW ONE ABOUT BACON AND TALLOW CANDLES CAN'T YOU TELL ANY LARDER STORIES
NO SAID THE TREE
THEN GOOD BYE SAID THE RATS AND THEY WENT HOME
AT LAST THE LITTLE MICE STAYED AWAY ALSO AND THE TREE SIGHED AFTER ALL IT WAS VERY PLEASANT WHEN THE SLEEK LITTLE MICE SAT ROUND ME AND LISTENED TO WHAT I TOLD THEM
NOW THAT TOO IS OVER
WHY ONE MORNING THERE CAME A QUANTITY OF PEOPLE AND SET TO WORK IN THE LOFT
THE TRUNKS WERE MOVED THE TREE WAS PULLED OUT AND THROWN RATHER HARD IT IS TRUE DOWN ON THE FLOOR BUT A MAN DREW HIM TOWARDS THE STAIRS WHERE THE DAYLIGHT SHONE
BUT IT WAS NOT THE FIR TREE THAT THEY MEANT
IT WAS IN A CORNER THAT HE LAY AMONG WEEDS AND NETTLES
THE GOLDEN STAR OF TINSEL WAS STILL ON THE TOP OF THE TREE AND GLITTERED IN THE SUNSHINE
IN THE COURT YARD SOME OF THE MERRY CHILDREN WERE PLAYING WHO HAD DANCED AT CHRISTMAS ROUND THE FIR TREE AND WERE SO GLAD AT THE SIGHT OF HIM
AND THE GARDENER'S BOY CHOPPED THE TREE INTO SMALL PIECES THERE WAS A WHOLE HEAP LYING THERE
THE WOOD FLAMED UP SPLENDIDLY UNDER THE LARGE BREWING COPPER AND IT SIGHED SO DEEPLY
HOWEVER THAT WAS OVER NOW THE TREE GONE THE STORY AT AN END
HER SEA GOING QUALITIES WERE EXCELLENT AND WOULD HAVE AMPLY SUFFICED FOR A CIRCUMNAVIGATION OF THE GLOBE
AFTER AN APPRENTICESHIP ON A MERCHANT SHIP HE HAD ENTERED THE IMPERIAL NAVY AND HAD ALREADY REACHED THE RANK OF LIEUTENANT WHEN THE COUNT APPOINTED HIM TO THE CHARGE OF HIS OWN PRIVATE YACHT IN WHICH HE WAS ACCUSTOMED TO SPEND BY FAR THE GREATER PART OF HIS TIME THROUGHOUT THE WINTER GENERALLY CRUISING IN THE MEDITERRANEAN WHILST IN THE SUMMER HE VISITED MORE NORTHERN WATERS
THE LATE ASTOUNDING EVENTS HOWEVER HAD RENDERED PROCOPE MANIFESTLY UNEASY AND NOT THE LESS SO FROM HIS CONSCIOUSNESS THAT THE COUNT SECRETLY PARTOOK OF HIS OWN ANXIETY
STEAM UP AND CANVAS SPREAD THE SCHOONER STARTED EASTWARDS
ALTHOUGH ONLY A MODERATE BREEZE WAS BLOWING THE SEA WAS ROUGH A CIRCUMSTANCE TO BE ACCOUNTED FOR ONLY BY THE DIMINUTION IN THE FORCE OF THE EARTH'S ATTRACTION RENDERING THE LIQUID PARTICLES SO BUOYANT THAT BY THE MERE EFFECT OF OSCILLATION THEY WERE CARRIED TO A HEIGHT THAT WAS QUITE UNPRECEDENTED
FOR A FEW MILES SHE FOLLOWED THE LINE HITHERTO PRESUMABLY OCCUPIED BY THE COAST OF ALGERIA BUT NO LAND APPEARED TO THE SOUTH
THE LOG AND THE COMPASS THEREFORE WERE ABLE TO BE CALLED UPON TO DO THE WORK OF THE SEXTANT WHICH HAD BECOME UTTERLY USELESS
THERE IS NO FEAR OF THAT SIR
THE EARTH HAS UNDOUBTEDLY ENTERED UPON A NEW ORBIT BUT SHE IS NOT INCURRING ANY PROBABLE RISK OF BEING PRECIPITATED ONTO THE SUN
AND WHAT DEMONSTRATION DO YOU OFFER ASKED SERVADAC EAGERLY THAT IT WILL NOT HAPPEN
OCEAN REIGNED SUPREME
ALL THE IMAGES OF HIS PAST LIFE FLOATED UPON HIS MEMORY HIS THOUGHTS SPED AWAY TO HIS NATIVE FRANCE ONLY TO RETURN AGAIN TO WONDER WHETHER THE DEPTHS OF OCEAN WOULD REVEAL ANY TRACES OF THE ALGERIAN METROPOLIS
IS IT NOT IMPOSSIBLE HE MURMURED ALOUD THAT ANY CITY SHOULD DISAPPEAR SO COMPLETELY
WOULD NOT THE LOFTIEST EMINENCES OF THE CITY AT LEAST BE VISIBLE
ANOTHER CIRCUMSTANCE WAS MOST REMARKABLE
TO THE SURPRISE OF ALL AND ESPECIALLY OF LIEUTENANT PROCOPE THE LINE INDICATED A BOTTOM AT A NEARLY UNIFORM DEPTH OF FROM FOUR TO FIVE FATHOMS AND ALTHOUGH THE SOUNDING WAS PERSEVERED WITH CONTINUOUSLY FOR MORE THAN TWO HOURS OVER A CONSIDERABLE AREA THE DIFFERENCES OF LEVEL WERE INSIGNIFICANT NOT CORRESPONDING IN ANY DEGREE TO WHAT WOULD BE EXPECTED OVER THE SITE OF A CITY THAT HAD BEEN TERRACED LIKE THE SEATS OF AN AMPHITHEATER
YOU MUST SEE LIEUTENANT I SHOULD THINK THAT WE ARE NOT SO NEAR THE COAST OF ALGERIA AS YOU IMAGINED
AFTER PONDERING AWHILE HE SAID IF WE WERE FARTHER AWAY I SHOULD EXPECT TO FIND A DEPTH OF TWO OR THREE HUNDRED FATHOMS INSTEAD OF FIVE FATHOMS FIVE FATHOMS
ITS DEPTH REMAINED INVARIABLE STILL FOUR OR AT MOST FIVE FATHOMS AND ALTHOUGH ITS BOTTOM WAS ASSIDUOUSLY DREDGED IT WAS ONLY TO PROVE IT BARREN OF MARINE PRODUCTION OF ANY TYPE
NOTHING WAS TO BE DONE BUT TO PUT ABOUT AND RETURN IN DISAPPOINTMENT TOWARDS THE NORTH
FAST AS HIS LEGS COULD CARRY HIM SERVADAC HAD MADE HIS WAY TO THE TOP OF THE CLIFF
IT WAS QUITE TRUE THAT A VESSEL WAS IN SIGHT HARDLY MORE THAN SIX MILES FROM THE SHORE BUT OWING TO THE INCREASE IN THE EARTH'S CONVEXITY AND THE CONSEQUENT LIMITATION OF THE RANGE OF VISION THE RIGGING OF THE TOPMASTS ALONE WAS VISIBLE ABOVE THE WATER
EXCLAIMED SERVADAC KEEPING HIS EYE UNMOVED AT HIS TELESCOPE
SHE IS UNDER SAIL BUT SHE IS COUNT TIMASCHEFF'S YACHT HE WAS RIGHT
IF THE COUNT WERE ON BOARD A STRANGE FATALITY WAS BRINGING HIM TO THE PRESENCE OF HIS RIVAL
HE RECKONED THEREFORE NOT ONLY UPON ASCERTAINING THE EXTENT OF THE LATE CATASTROPHE BUT UPON LEARNING ITS CAUSE
THE WIND BEING ADVERSE THE DOBRYNA DID NOT MAKE VERY RAPID PROGRESS BUT AS THE WEATHER IN SPITE OF A FEW CLOUDS REMAINED CALM AND THE SEA WAS QUITE SMOOTH SHE WAS ENABLED TO HOLD A STEADY COURSE
SERVADAC TOOK IT FOR GRANTED THAT THE DOBRYNA WAS ENDEAVORING TO PUT IN
A NARROW CHANNEL FORMED A PASSAGE THROUGH THE RIDGE OF ROCKS THAT PROTECTED IT FROM THE OPEN SEA AND WHICH EVEN IN THE ROUGHEST WEATHER WOULD ENSURE THE CALMNESS OF ITS WATERS
SLIGHTLY CHANGING HER COURSE SHE FIRST STRUCK HER MAINSAIL AND IN ORDER TO FACILITATE THE MOVEMENTS OF HER HELMSMAN SOON CARRIED NOTHING BUT HER TWO TOPSAILS BRIGANTINE AND JIB
CAPTAIN SERVADAC HASTENED TOWARDS HIM
I LEFT YOU ON A CONTINENT AND HERE I HAVE THE HONOR OF FINDING YOU ON AN ISLAND
NEVER MIND NOW INTERPOSED THE CAPTAIN WE WILL TALK OF THAT BY AND BY
NOTHING MORE THAN YOU KNOW YOURSELF
ARE YOU CERTAIN THAT THIS IS THE MEDITERRANEAN
FOR SOME MOMENTS HE SEEMED PERFECTLY STUPEFIED THEN RECOVERING HIMSELF HE BEGAN TO OVERWHELM THE COUNT WITH A TORRENT OF QUESTIONS
TO ALL THESE INQUIRIES THE COUNT RESPONDED IN THE AFFIRMATIVE
SOME MYSTERIOUS FORCE SEEMED TO HAVE BROUGHT ABOUT A CONVULSION OF THE ELEMENTS
YOU WILL TAKE ME ON BOARD COUNT WILL YOU NOT
MY YACHT IS AT YOUR SERVICE SIR EVEN SHOULD YOU REQUIRE TO MAKE A TOUR ROUND THE WORLD
THE COUNT SHOOK HIS HEAD
BEFORE STARTING IT WAS INDISPENSABLE THAT THE ENGINE OF THE DOBRYNA SHOULD BE REPAIRED TO SAIL UNDER CANVAS ONLY WOULD IN CONTRARY WINDS AND ROUGH SEAS BE BOTH TEDIOUS AND DIFFICULT
IT WAS ON THE LAST DAY OF JANUARY THAT THE REPAIRS OF THE SCHOONER WERE COMPLETED
A SLIGHT DIMINUTION IN THE EXCESSIVELY HIGH TEMPERATURE WHICH HAD PREVAILED FOR THE LAST FEW WEEKS WAS THE ONLY APPARENT CHANGE IN THE GENERAL ORDER OF THINGS BUT WHETHER THIS WAS TO BE ATTRIBUTED TO ANY ALTERATION IN THE EARTH'S ORBIT WAS A QUESTION WHICH WOULD STILL REQUIRE SEVERAL DAYS TO DECIDE
DOUBTS NOW AROSE AND SOME DISCUSSION FOLLOWED WHETHER OR NOT IT WAS DESIRABLE FOR BEN ZOOF TO ACCOMPANY HIS MASTER
LENGTH OF SERVICE FOURTEEN YEARS THREE MONTHS AND FIVE DAYS
HE SEEMED BORN TO PLEASE WITHOUT BEING CONSCIOUS OF THE POWER HE POSSESSED
IT MUST BE OWNED AND NO ONE WAS MORE READY TO CONFESS IT THAN HIMSELF THAT HIS LITERARY ATTAINMENTS WERE BY NO MEANS OF A HIGH ORDER
WE DON'T SPIN TOPS IS A FAVORITE SAYING AMONGST ARTILLERY OFFICERS INDICATING THAT THEY DO NOT SHIRK THEIR DUTY BY FRIVOLOUS PURSUITS BUT IT MUST BE CONFESSED THAT SERVADAC BEING NATURALLY IDLE WAS VERY MUCH GIVEN TO SPINNING TOPS
ONCE IN ACTION HE WAS LEADING A DETACHMENT OF INFANTRY THROUGH AN INTRENCHMENT
SOMETIMES HE WOULD WANDER ON FOOT UPON THE SANDY SHORE AND SOMETIMES HE WOULD ENJOY A RIDE ALONG THE SUMMIT OF THE CLIFF ALTOGETHER BEING IN NO HURRY AT ALL TO BRING HIS TASK TO AN END
NO CATHEDRAL NOT EVEN BURGOS ITSELF COULD VIE WITH THE CHURCH AT MONTMARTRE
BEN ZOOF'S MOST AMBITIOUS DESIRE WAS TO INDUCE THE CAPTAIN TO GO WITH HIM AND END HIS DAYS IN HIS MUCH LOVED HOME AND SO INCESSANTLY WERE SERVADAC'S EARS BESIEGED WITH DESCRIPTIONS OF THE UNPARALLELED BEAUTIES AND ADVANTAGES OF THIS EIGHTEENTH ARRONDISSEMENT OF PARIS THAT HE COULD SCARCELY HEAR THE NAME OF MONTMARTRE WITHOUT A CONSCIOUS THRILL OF AVERSION
WHEN A PRIVATE IN THE EIGHTH CAVALRY HE HAD BEEN ON THE POINT OF QUITTING THE ARMY AT TWENTY EIGHT YEARS OF AGE BUT UNEXPECTEDLY HE HAD BEEN APPOINTED ORDERLY TO CAPTAIN SERVADAC
THE BOND OF UNION THUS EFFECTED COULD NEVER BE SEVERED AND ALTHOUGH BEN ZOOF'S ACHIEVEMENTS HAD FAIRLY EARNED HIM THE RIGHT OF RETIREMENT HE FIRMLY DECLINED ALL HONORS OR ANY PENSION THAT MIGHT PART HIM FROM HIS SUPERIOR OFFICER
UNLIKE HIS MASTER HE MADE NO PRETENSION TO ANY GIFT OF POETIC POWER BUT HIS INEXHAUSTIBLE MEMORY MADE HIM A LIVING ENCYCLOPAEDIA AND FOR HIS STOCK OF ANECDOTES AND TROOPER'S TALES HE WAS MATCHLESS
TO CELEBRATE THE ARRIVAL OF HER SON SILVIA GAVE A SPLENDID SUPPER TO WHICH SHE HAD INVITED ALL HER RELATIVES AND IT WAS A GOOD OPPORTUNITY FOR ME TO MAKE THEIR ACQUAINTANCE
WITHOUT SAYING IT POSITIVELY SHE MADE ME UNDERSTAND THAT BEING HERSELF AN ILLUSTRIOUS MEMBER OF THE REPUBLIC OF LETTERS SHE WAS WELL AWARE THAT SHE WAS SPEAKING TO AN INSECT
IN ORDER TO PLEASE HER I SPOKE TO HER OF THE ABBE CONTI AND I HAD OCCASION TO QUOTE TWO LINES OF THAT PROFOUND WRITER
MADAM CORRECTED ME WITH A PATRONIZING AIR FOR MY PRONUNCIATION OF THE WORD SCEVRA WHICH MEANS DIVIDED SAYING THAT IT OUGHT TO BE PRONOUNCED SCEURA AND SHE ADDED THAT I OUGHT TO BE VERY GLAD TO HAVE LEARNED SO MUCH ON THE FIRST DAY OF MY ARRIVAL IN PARIS TELLING ME THAT IT WOULD BE AN IMPORTANT DAY IN MY LIFE
HER FACE WAS AN ENIGMA FOR IT INSPIRED EVERYONE WITH THE WARMEST SYMPATHY AND YET IF YOU EXAMINED IT ATTENTIVELY THERE WAS NOT ONE BEAUTIFUL FEATURE SHE COULD NOT BE CALLED HANDSOME BUT NO ONE COULD HAVE THOUGHT HER UGLY
SILVIA WAS THE ADORATION OF FRANCE AND HER TALENT WAS THE REAL SUPPORT OF ALL THE COMEDIES WHICH THE GREATEST AUTHORS WROTE FOR HER ESPECIALLY OF THE PLAYS OF MARIVAUX FOR WITHOUT HER HIS COMEDIES WOULD NEVER HAVE GONE TO POSTERITY
SILVIA DID NOT THINK THAT HER GOOD CONDUCT WAS A MERIT FOR SHE KNEW THAT SHE WAS VIRTUOUS ONLY BECAUSE HER SELF LOVE COMPELLED HER TO BE SO AND SHE NEVER EXHIBITED ANY PRIDE OR ASSUMED ANY SUPERIORITY TOWARDS HER THEATRICAL SISTERS ALTHOUGH SATISFIED TO SHINE BY THEIR TALENT OR THEIR BEAUTY THEY CARED LITTLE ABOUT RENDERING THEMSELVES CONSPICUOUS BY THEIR VIRTUE
TWO YEARS BEFORE HER DEATH I SAW HER PERFORM THE CHARACTER OF MARIANNE IN THE COMEDY OF MARIVAUX AND IN SPITE OF HER AGE AND DECLINING HEALTH THE ILLUSION WAS COMPLETE
SHE WAS HONOURABLY BURIED IN THE CHURCH OF SAINT SAUVEUR WITHOUT THE SLIGHTEST OPPOSITION FROM THE VENERABLE PRIEST WHO FAR FROM SHARING THE ANTI CHRISTAIN INTOLERANCY OF THE CLERGY IN GENERAL SAID THAT HER PROFESSION AS AN ACTRESS HAD NOT HINDERED HER FROM BEING A GOOD CHRISTIAN AND THAT THE EARTH WAS THE COMMON MOTHER OF ALL HUMAN BEINGS AS JESUS CHRIST HAD BEEN THE SAVIOUR OF ALL MANKIND
YOU WILL FORGIVE ME DEAR READER IF I HAVE MADE YOU ATTEND THE FUNERAL OF SILVIA TEN YEARS BEFORE HER DEATH BELIEVE ME I HAVE NO INTENTION OF PERFORMING A MIRACLE YOU MAY CONSOLE YOURSELF WITH THE IDEA THAT I SHALL SPARE YOU THAT UNPLEASANT TASK WHEN POOR SILVIA DIES
I NEVER HAD ANY FAMILY
I HAD A NAME I BELIEVE IN MY YOUNG DAYS BUT I HAVE FORGOTTEN IT SINCE I HAVE BEEN IN SERVICE
I SHALL CALL YOU ESPRIT
YOU DO ME A GREAT HONOUR
HERE GO AND GET ME CHANGE FOR A LOUIS I HAVE IT SIR
AT YOUR SERVICE SIR
MADAME QUINSON BESIDES CAN ANSWER YOUR ENQUIRIES
I SEE A QUANTITY OF CHAIRS FOR HIRE AT THE RATE OF ONE SOU MEN READING THE NEWSPAPER UNDER THE SHADE OF THE TREES GIRLS AND MEN BREAKFASTING EITHER ALONE OR IN COMPANY WAITERS WHO WERE RAPIDLY GOING UP AND DOWN A NARROW STAIRCASE HIDDEN UNDER THE FOLIAGE
I SIT DOWN AT A SMALL TABLE A WAITER COMES IMMEDIATELY TO ENQUIRE MY WISHES
I TELL HIM TO GIVE ME SOME COFFEE IF IT IS GOOD
THEN TURNING TOWARDS ME HE SAYS THAT I LOOK LIKE A FOREIGNER AND WHEN I SAY THAT I AM AN ITALIAN HE BEGINS TO SPEAK TO ME OF THE COURT OF THE CITY OF THE THEATRES AND AT LAST HE OFFERS TO ACCOMPANY ME EVERYWHERE
I THANK HIM AND TAKE MY LEAVE
I ADDRESS HIM IN ITALIAN AND HE ANSWERS VERY WITTILY BUT HIS WAY OF SPEAKING MAKES ME SMILE AND I TELL HIM WHY
MY REMARK PLEASES HIM BUT I SOON PROVE TO HIM THAT IT IS NOT THE RIGHT WAY TO SPEAK HOWEVER PERFECT MAY HAVE BEEN THE LANGUAGE OF THAT ANCIENT WRITER
I SEE A CROWD IN ONE CORNER OF THE GARDEN EVERYBODY STANDING STILL AND LOOKING UP
IS THERE NOT A MERIDIAN EVERYWHERE
YES BUT THE MERIDIAN OF THE PALAIS ROYAL IS THE MOST EXACT
THAT IS TRUE BADAUDERIE
ALL THESE HONEST PERSONS ARE WAITING THEIR TURN TO GET THEIR SNUFF BOXES FILLED
IT IS SOLD EVERYWHERE BUT FOR THE LAST THREE WEEKS NOBODY WILL USE ANY SNUFF BUT THAT SOLD AT THE CIVET CAT
IS IT BETTER THAN ANYWHERE ELSE
BUT HOW DID SHE MANAGE TO RENDER IT SO FASHIONABLE
SIMPLY BY STOPPING HER CARRIAGE TWO OR THREE TIMES BEFORE THE SHOP TO HAVE HER SNUFF BOX FILLED AND BY SAYING ALOUD TO THE YOUNG GIRL WHO HANDED BACK THE BOX THAT HER SNUFF WAS THE VERY BEST IN PARIS
YOU ARE NOW IN THE ONLY COUNTRY IN THE WORLD WHERE WIT CAN MAKE A FORTUNE BY SELLING EITHER A GENUINE OR A FALSE ARTICLE IN THE FIRST CASE IT RECEIVES THE WELCOME OF INTELLIGENT AND TALENTED PEOPLE AND IN THE SECOND FOOLS ARE ALWAYS READY TO REWARD IT FOR SILLINESS IS TRULY A CHARACTERISTIC OF THE PEOPLE HERE AND HOWEVER WONDERFUL IT MAY APPEAR SILLINESS IS THE DAUGHTER OF WIT
LET A MAN RUN AND EVERYBODY WILL RUN AFTER HIM THE CROWD WILL NOT STOP UNLESS THE MAN IS PROVED TO BE MAD BUT TO PROVE IT IS INDEED A DIFFICULT TASK BECAUSE WE HAVE A CROWD OF MEN WHO MAD FROM THEIR BIRTH ARE STILL CONSIDERED WISE
IT SEEMS TO ME I REPLIED THAT SUCH APPROVAL SUCH RATIFICATION OF THE OPINION EXPRESSED BY THE KING THE PRINCES OF THE BLOOD ET CETERA IS RATHER A PROOF OF THE AFFECTION FELT FOR THEM BY THE NATION FOR THE FRENCH CARRY THAT AFFECTION TO SUCH AN EXTENT THAT THEY BELIEVE THEM INFALLIBLE
WHEN THE KING COMES TO PARIS EVERYBODY CALLS OUT VIVE LE ROI
SHE INTRODUCED ME TO ALL HER GUESTS AND GAVE ME SOME PARTICULARS RESPECTING EVERY ONE OF THEM
WHAT SIR I SAID TO HIM AM I FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO SEE YOU
HE HIMSELF RECITED THE SAME PASSAGE IN FRENCH AND POLITELY POINTED OUT THE PARTS IN WHICH HE THOUGHT THAT I HAD IMPROVED ON THE ORIGINAL
FOR THE FIRST DAY SIR I THINK THAT WHAT YOU HAVE DONE GIVES GREAT HOPES OF YOU AND WITHOUT ANY DOUBT YOU WILL MAKE RAPID PROGRESS
I BELIEVE IT SIR AND THAT IS WHAT I FEAR THEREFORE THE PRINCIPAL OBJECT OF MY VISIT HERE IS TO DEVOTE MYSELF ENTIRELY TO THE STUDY OF THE FRENCH LANGUAGE
I AM A VERY UNPLEASANT PUPIL ALWAYS ASKING QUESTIONS CURIOUS TROUBLESOME INSATIABLE AND EVEN SUPPOSING THAT I COULD MEET WITH THE TEACHER I REQUIRE I AM AFRAID I AM NOT RICH ENOUGH TO PAY HIM
I RESIDE IN THE MARAIS RUE DE DOUZE PORTES
I WILL MAKE YOU TRANSLATE THEM INTO FRENCH AND YOU NEED NOT BE AFRAID OF MY FINDING YOU INSATIABLE
HE HAD A GOOD APPETITE COULD TELL A GOOD STORY WITHOUT LAUGHING WAS CELEBRATED FOR HIS WITTY REPARTEES AND HIS SOCIABLE MANNERS BUT HE SPENT HIS LIFE AT HOME SELDOM GOING OUT AND SEEING HARDLY ANYONE BECAUSE HE ALWAYS HAD A PIPE IN HIS MOUTH AND WAS SURROUNDED BY AT LEAST TWENTY CATS WITH WHICH HE WOULD AMUSE HIMSELF ALL DAY
HIS HOUSEKEEPER HAD THE MANAGEMENT OF EVERYTHING SHE NEVER ALLOWED HIM TO BE IN NEED OF ANYTHING AND SHE GAVE NO ACCOUNT OF HIS MONEY WHICH SHE KEPT ALTOGETHER BECAUSE HE NEVER ASKED HER TO RENDER ANY ACCOUNTS
HE COULD WAIT NO LONGER
FOR A FULL HOUR HE HAD PACED UP AND DOWN WAITING BUT HE COULD WAIT NO LONGER
HE SET OFF ABRUPTLY FOR THE BULL WALKING RAPIDLY LEST HIS FATHER'S SHRILL WHISTLE MIGHT CALL HIM BACK AND IN A FEW MOMENTS HE HAD ROUNDED THE CURVE AT THE POLICE BARRACK AND WAS SAFE
THE UNIVERSITY
PRIDE AFTER SATISFACTION UPLIFTED HIM LIKE LONG SLOW WAVES
WHOSE FEET ARE AS THE FEET OF HARTS AND UNDERNEATH THE EVERLASTING ARMS
THE PRIDE OF THAT DIM IMAGE BROUGHT BACK TO HIS MIND THE DIGNITY OF THE OFFICE HE HAD REFUSED
SOON THE WHOLE BRIDGE WAS TREMBLING AND RESOUNDING
THE UNCOUTH FACES PASSED HIM TWO BY TWO STAINED YELLOW OR RED OR LIVID BY THE SEA AND AS HE STROVE TO LOOK AT THEM WITH EASE AND INDIFFERENCE A FAINT STAIN OF PERSONAL SHAME AND COMMISERATION ROSE TO HIS OWN FACE
ANGRY WITH HIMSELF HE TRIED TO HIDE HIS FACE FROM THEIR EYES BY GAZING DOWN SIDEWAYS INTO THE SHALLOW SWIRLING WATER UNDER THE BRIDGE BUT HE STILL SAW A REFLECTION THEREIN OF THEIR TOP HEAVY SILK HATS AND HUMBLE TAPE LIKE COLLARS AND LOOSELY HANGING CLERICAL CLOTHES BROTHER HICKEY
BROTHER MAC ARDLE BROTHER KEOGH
THEIR PIETY WOULD BE LIKE THEIR NAMES LIKE THEIR FACES LIKE THEIR CLOTHES AND IT WAS IDLE FOR HIM TO TELL HIMSELF THAT THEIR HUMBLE AND CONTRITE HEARTS IT MIGHT BE PAID A FAR RICHER TRIBUTE OF DEVOTION THAN HIS HAD EVER BEEN A GIFT TENFOLD MORE ACCEPTABLE THAN HIS ELABORATE ADORATION
IT WAS IDLE FOR HIM TO MOVE HIMSELF TO BE GENEROUS TOWARDS THEM TO TELL HIMSELF THAT IF HE EVER CAME TO THEIR GATES STRIPPED OF HIS PRIDE BEATEN AND IN BEGGAR'S WEEDS THAT THEY WOULD BE GENEROUS TOWARDS HIM LOVING HIM AS THEMSELVES
IDLE AND EMBITTERING FINALLY TO ARGUE AGAINST HIS OWN DISPASSIONATE CERTITUDE THAT THE COMMANDMENT OF LOVE BADE US NOT TO LOVE OUR NEIGHBOUR AS OURSELVES WITH THE SAME AMOUNT AND INTENSITY OF LOVE BUT TO LOVE HIM AS OURSELVES WITH THE SAME KIND OF LOVE
THE PHRASE AND THE DAY AND THE SCENE HARMONIZED IN A CHORD
WORDS WAS IT THEIR COLOURS
THEY WERE VOYAGING ACROSS THE DESERTS OF THE SKY A HOST OF NOMADS ON THE MARCH VOYAGING HIGH OVER IRELAND WESTWARD BOUND
THE EUROPE THEY HAD COME FROM LAY OUT THERE BEYOND THE IRISH SEA EUROPE OF STRANGE TONGUES AND VALLEYED AND WOODBEGIRT AND CITADELLED AND OF ENTRENCHED AND MARSHALLED RACES
AGAIN AGAIN
A VOICE FROM BEYOND THE WORLD WAS CALLING
HELLO STEPHANOS HERE COMES THE DEDALUS
THEIR DIVING STONE POISED ON ITS RUDE SUPPORTS AND ROCKING UNDER THEIR PLUNGES AND THE ROUGH HEWN STONES OF THE SLOPING BREAKWATER OVER WHICH THEY SCRAMBLED IN THEIR HORSEPLAY GLEAMED WITH COLD WET LUSTRE
HE STOOD STILL IN DEFERENCE TO THEIR CALLS AND PARRIED THEIR BANTER WITH EASY WORDS
IT WAS A PAIN TO SEE THEM AND A SWORD LIKE PAIN TO SEE THE SIGNS OF ADOLESCENCE THAT MADE REPELLENT THEIR PITIABLE NAKEDNESS
STEPHANOS DEDALOS
A MOMENT BEFORE THE GHOST OF THE ANCIENT KINGDOM OF THE DANES HAD LOOKED FORTH THROUGH THE VESTURE OF THE HAZEWRAPPED CITY
HE HOPED THERE WOULD BE STEW FOR DINNER TURNIPS AND CARROTS AND BRUISED POTATOES AND FAT MUTTON PIECES TO BE LADLED OUT IN THICK PEPPERED FLOUR FATTENED SAUCE
STUFF IT INTO YOU HIS BELLY COUNSELLED HIM
AFTER EARLY NIGHTFALL THE YELLOW LAMPS WOULD LIGHT UP HERE AND THERE THE SQUALID QUARTER OF THE BROTHELS
HELLO BERTIE ANY GOOD IN YOUR MIND
NUMBER TEN FRESH NELLY IS WAITING ON YOU GOOD NIGHT HUSBAND
THE MUSIC CAME NEARER AND HE RECALLED THE WORDS THE WORDS OF SHELLEY'S FRAGMENT UPON THE MOON WANDERING COMPANIONLESS PALE FOR WEARINESS
THE DULL LIGHT FELL MORE FAINTLY UPON THE PAGE WHEREON ANOTHER EQUATION BEGAN TO UNFOLD ITSELF SLOWLY AND TO SPREAD ABROAD ITS WIDENING TAIL
A COLD LUCID INDIFFERENCE REIGNED IN HIS SOUL
THE CHAOS IN WHICH HIS ARDOUR EXTINGUISHED ITSELF WAS A COLD INDIFFERENT KNOWLEDGE OF HIMSELF
AT MOST BY AN ALMS GIVEN TO A BEGGAR WHOSE BLESSING HE FLED FROM HE MIGHT HOPE WEARILY TO WIN FOR HIMSELF SOME MEASURE OF ACTUAL GRACE
WELL NOW ENNIS I DECLARE YOU HAVE A HEAD AND SO HAS MY STICK
ON SATURDAY MORNINGS WHEN THE SODALITY MET IN THE CHAPEL TO RECITE THE LITTLE OFFICE HIS PLACE WAS A CUSHIONED KNEELING DESK AT THE RIGHT OF THE ALTAR FROM WHICH HE LED HIS WING OF BOYS THROUGH THE RESPONSES
HER EYES SEEMED TO REGARD HIM WITH MILD PITY HER HOLINESS A STRANGE LIGHT GLOWING FAINTLY UPON HER FRAIL FLESH DID NOT HUMILIATE THE SINNER WHO APPROACHED HER
IF EVER HE WAS IMPELLED TO CAST SIN FROM HIM AND TO REPENT THE IMPULSE THAT MOVED HIM WAS THE WISH TO BE HER KNIGHT
HE TRIED TO THINK HOW IT COULD BE
BUT THE DUSK DEEPENING IN THE SCHOOLROOM COVERED OVER HIS THOUGHTS THE BELL RANG
THEN YOU CAN ASK HIM QUESTIONS ON THE CATECHISM DEDALUS
STEPHEN LEANING BACK AND DRAWING IDLY ON HIS SCRIBBLER LISTENED TO THE TALK ABOUT HIM WHICH HERON CHECKED FROM TIME TO TIME BY SAYING
IT WAS STRANGE TOO THAT HE FOUND AN ARID PLEASURE IN FOLLOWING UP TO THE END THE RIGID LINES OF THE DOCTRINES OF THE CHURCH AND PENETRATING INTO OBSCURE SILENCES ONLY TO HEAR AND FEEL THE MORE DEEPLY HIS OWN CONDEMNATION
THE SENTENCE OF SAINT JAMES WHICH SAYS THAT HE WHO OFFENDS AGAINST ONE COMMANDMENT BECOMES GUILTY OF ALL HAD SEEMED TO HIM FIRST A SWOLLEN PHRASE UNTIL HE HAD BEGUN TO GROPE IN THE DARKNESS OF HIS OWN STATE
IF A MAN HAD STOLEN A POUND IN HIS YOUTH AND HAD USED THAT POUND TO AMASS A HUGE FORTUNE HOW MUCH WAS HE OBLIGED TO GIVE BACK THE POUND HE HAD STOLEN ONLY OR THE POUND TOGETHER WITH THE COMPOUND INTEREST ACCRUING UPON IT OR ALL HIS HUGE FORTUNE
IF A LAYMAN IN GIVING BAPTISM POUR THE WATER BEFORE SAYING THE WORDS IS THE CHILD BAPTIZED
HOW COMES IT THAT WHILE THE FIRST BEATITUDE PROMISES THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN TO THE POOR OF HEART THE SECOND BEATITUDE PROMISES ALSO TO THE MEEK THAT THEY SHALL POSSESS THE LAND
WHY WAS THE SACRAMENT OF THE EUCHARIST INSTITUTED UNDER THE TWO SPECIES OF BREAD AND WINE IF JESUS CHRIST BE PRESENT BODY AND BLOOD SOUL AND DIVINITY IN THE BREAD ALONE AND IN THE WINE ALONE
IF THE WINE CHANGE INTO VINEGAR AND THE HOST CRUMBLE INTO CORRUPTION AFTER THEY HAVE BEEN CONSECRATED IS JESUS CHRIST STILL PRESENT UNDER THEIR SPECIES AS GOD AND AS MAN
A GENTLE KICK FROM THE TALL BOY IN THE BENCH BEHIND URGED STEPHEN TO ASK A DIFFICULT QUESTION
THE RECTOR DID NOT ASK FOR A CATECHISM TO HEAR THE LESSON FROM
HE CLASPED HIS HANDS ON THE DESK AND SAID
THE RETREAT WILL BEGIN ON WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON IN HONOUR OF SAINT FRANCIS XAVIER WHOSE FEAST DAY IS SATURDAY
ON FRIDAY CONFESSION WILL BE HEARD ALL THE AFTERNOON AFTER BEADS
BEWARE OF MAKING THAT MISTAKE
STEPHEN'S HEART BEGAN SLOWLY TO FOLD AND FADE WITH FEAR LIKE A WITHERING FLOWER
HE IS CALLED AS YOU KNOW THE APOSTLE OF THE INDIES
A GREAT SAINT SAINT FRANCIS XAVIER
THE RECTOR PAUSED AND THEN SHAKING HIS CLASPED HANDS BEFORE HIM WENT ON
HE HAD THE FAITH IN HIM THAT MOVES MOUNTAINS
A GREAT SAINT SAINT FRANCIS XAVIER
IN THE SILENCE THEIR DARK FIRE KINDLED THE DUSK INTO A TAWNY GLOW
YOU WILL FIND ME CONTINUALLY SPEAKING OF FOUR MEN TITIAN HOLBEIN TURNER AND TINTORET IN ALMOST THE SAME TERMS
THEY UNITE EVERY QUALITY AND SOMETIMES YOU WILL FIND ME REFERRING TO THEM AS COLORISTS SOMETIMES AS CHIAROSCURISTS
BY BEING STUDIOUS OF COLOR THEY ARE STUDIOUS OF DIVISION AND WHILE THE CHIAROSCURIST DEVOTES HIMSELF TO THE REPRESENTATION OF DEGREES OF FORCE IN ONE THING UNSEPARATED LIGHT THE COLORISTS HAVE FOR THEIR FUNCTION THE ATTAINMENT OF BEAUTY BY ARRANGEMENT OF THE DIVISIONS OF LIGHT
MY FIRST AND PRINCIPAL REASON WAS THAT THEY ENFORCED BEYOND ALL RESISTANCE ON ANY STUDENT WHO MIGHT ATTEMPT TO COPY THEM THIS METHOD OF LAYING PORTIONS OF DISTINCT HUE SIDE BY SIDE
SOME OF THE TOUCHES INDEED WHEN THE TINT HAS BEEN MIXED WITH MUCH WATER HAVE BEEN LAID IN LITTLE DROPS OR PONDS SO THAT THE PIGMENT MIGHT CRYSTALLIZE HARD AT THE EDGE
IT IS THE HEAD OF A PARROT WITH A LITTLE FLOWER IN HIS BEAK FROM A PICTURE OF CARPACCIO'S ONE OF HIS SERIES OF THE LIFE OF SAINT GEORGE
THEN HE COMES TO THE BEAK OF IT
THE BROWN GROUND BENEATH IS LEFT FOR THE MOST PART ONE TOUCH OF BLACK IS PUT FOR THE HOLLOW TWO DELICATE LINES OF DARK GRAY DEFINE THE OUTER CURVE AND ONE LITTLE QUIVERING TOUCH OF WHITE DRAWS THE INNER EDGE OF THE MANDIBLE
FOR BELIEVE ME THE FINAL PHILOSOPHY OF ART CAN ONLY RATIFY THEIR OPINION THAT THE BEAUTY OF A COCK ROBIN IS TO BE RED AND OF A GRASS PLOT TO BE GREEN AND THE BEST SKILL OF ART IS IN INSTANTLY SEIZING ON THE MANIFOLD DELICIOUSNESS OF LIGHT WHICH YOU CAN ONLY SEIZE BY PRECISION OF INSTANTANEOUS TOUCH
NOW YOU WILL SEE IN THESE STUDIES THAT THE MOMENT THE WHITE IS INCLOSED PROPERLY AND HARMONIZED WITH THE OTHER HUES IT BECOMES SOMEHOW MORE PRECIOUS AND PEARLY THAN THE WHITE PAPER AND THAT I AM NOT AFRAID TO LEAVE A WHOLE FIELD OF UNTREATED WHITE PAPER ALL ROUND IT BEING SURE THAT EVEN THE LITTLE DIAMONDS IN THE ROUND WINDOW WILL TELL AS JEWELS IF THEY ARE GRADATED JUSTLY
BUT IN THIS VIGNETTE COPIED FROM TURNER YOU HAVE THE TWO PRINCIPLES BROUGHT OUT PERFECTLY
THEY ARE BEYOND ALL OTHER WORKS THAT I KNOW EXISTING DEPENDENT FOR THEIR EFFECT ON LOW SUBDUED TONES THEIR FAVORITE CHOICE IN TIME OF DAY BEING EITHER DAWN OR TWILIGHT AND EVEN THEIR BRIGHTEST SUNSETS PRODUCED CHIEFLY OUT OF GRAY PAPER
IT MAY BE THAT A GREAT COLORIST WILL USE HIS UTMOST FORCE OF COLOR AS A SINGER HIS FULL POWER OF VOICE BUT LOUD OR LOW THE VIRTUE IS IN BOTH CASES ALWAYS IN REFINEMENT NEVER IN LOUDNESS
IT MUST REMEMBER BE ONE OR THE OTHER
DO NOT THEREFORE THINK THAT THE GOTHIC SCHOOL IS AN EASY ONE
THE LAW OF THAT SCHOOL IS THAT EVERYTHING SHALL BE SEEN CLEARLY OR AT LEAST ONLY IN SUCH MIST OR FAINTNESS AS SHALL BE DELIGHTFUL AND I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT THE BEST INTRODUCTION TO IT WOULD BE THE ELEMENTARY PRACTICE OF PAINTING EVERY STUDY ON A GOLDEN GROUND
THIS AT ONCE COMPELS YOU TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE WORK IS TO BE IMAGINATIVE AND DECORATIVE THAT IT REPRESENTS BEAUTIFUL THINGS IN THE CLEAREST WAY BUT NOT UNDER EXISTING CONDITIONS AND THAT IN FACT YOU ARE PRODUCING JEWELER'S WORK RATHER THAN PICTURES
THAT A STYLE IS RESTRAINED OR SEVERE DOES NOT MEAN THAT IT IS ALSO ERRONEOUS
IN ALL EARLY GOTHIC ART INDEED YOU WILL FIND FAILURE OF THIS KIND ESPECIALLY DISTORTION AND RIGIDITY WHICH ARE IN MANY RESPECTS PAINFULLY TO BE COMPARED WITH THE SPLENDID REPOSE OF CLASSIC ART
THE LARGE LETTER CONTAINS INDEED ENTIRELY FEEBLE AND ILL DRAWN FIGURES THAT IS MERELY CHILDISH AND FAILING WORK OF AN INFERIOR HAND IT IS NOT CHARACTERISTIC OF GOTHIC OR ANY OTHER SCHOOL
BUT OBSERVE YOU CAN ONLY DO THIS ON ONE CONDITION THAT OF STRIVING ALSO TO CREATE IN REALITY THE BEAUTY WHICH YOU SEEK IN IMAGINATION
IT WILL BE WHOLLY IMPOSSIBLE FOR YOU TO RETAIN THE TRANQUILLITY OF TEMPER AND FELICITY OF FAITH NECESSARY FOR NOBLE PURIST PAINTING UNLESS YOU ARE ACTIVELY ENGAGED IN PROMOTING THE FELICITY AND PEACE OF PRACTICAL LIFE
YOU MUST LOOK AT HIM IN THE FACE FIGHT HIM CONQUER HIM WITH WHAT SCATHE YOU MAY YOU NEED NOT THINK TO KEEP OUT OF THE WAY OF HIM
THE COLORIST SAYS FIRST OF ALL AS MY DELICIOUS PAROQUET WAS RUBY SO THIS NASTY VIPER SHALL BE BLACK AND THEN IS THE QUESTION CAN I ROUND HIM OFF EVEN THOUGH HE IS BLACK AND MAKE HIM SLIMY AND YET SPRINGY AND CLOSE DOWN CLOTTED LIKE A POOL OF BLACK BLOOD ON THE EARTH ALL THE SAME
NOTHING WILL BE MORE PRECIOUS TO YOU I THINK IN THE PRACTICAL STUDY OF ART THAN THE CONVICTION WHICH WILL FORCE ITSELF ON YOU MORE AND MORE EVERY HOUR OF THE WAY ALL THINGS ARE BOUND TOGETHER LITTLE AND GREAT IN SPIRIT AND IN MATTER
YOU KNOW I HAVE JUST BEEN TELLING YOU HOW THIS SCHOOL OF MATERIALISM AND CLAY INVOLVED ITSELF AT LAST IN CLOUD AND FIRE
HERE IS AN EQUALLY TYPICAL GREEK SCHOOL LANDSCAPE BY WILSON LOST WHOLLY IN GOLDEN MIST THE TREES SO SLIGHTLY DRAWN THAT YOU DON'T KNOW IF THEY ARE TREES OR TOWERS AND NO CARE FOR COLOR WHATEVER PERFECTLY DECEPTIVE AND MARVELOUS EFFECT OF SUNSHINE THROUGH THE MIST APOLLO AND THE PYTHON
NOW HERE IS RAPHAEL EXACTLY BETWEEN THE TWO TREES STILL DRAWN LEAF BY LEAF WHOLLY FORMAL BUT BEAUTIFUL MIST COMING GRADUALLY INTO THE DISTANCE
WELL THEN LAST HERE IS TURNER'S GREEK SCHOOL OF THE HIGHEST CLASS AND YOU DEFINE HIS ART ABSOLUTELY AS FIRST THE DISPLAYING INTENSELY AND WITH THE STERNEST INTELLECT OF NATURAL FORM AS IT IS AND THEN THE ENVELOPMENT OF IT WITH CLOUD AND FIRE
ONLY THERE ARE TWO SORTS OF CLOUD AND FIRE
HE KNOWS THEM BOTH
THERE'S ONE AND THERE'S ANOTHER THE DUDLEY AND THE FLINT
IT IS ONLY A PENCIL OUTLINE BY EDWARD BURNE JONES IN ILLUSTRATION OF THE STORY OF PSYCHE IT IS THE INTRODUCTION OF PSYCHE AFTER ALL HER TROUBLES INTO HEAVEN
EVERY PLANT IN THE GRASS IS SET FORMALLY GROWS PERFECTLY AND MAY BE REALIZED COMPLETELY
EXQUISITE ORDER AND UNIVERSAL WITH ETERNAL LIFE AND LIGHT THIS IS THE FAITH AND EFFORT OF THE SCHOOLS OF CRYSTAL AND YOU MAY DESCRIBE AND COMPLETE THEIR WORK QUITE LITERALLY BY TAKING ANY VERSES OF CHAUCER IN HIS TENDER MOOD AND OBSERVING HOW HE INSISTS ON THE CLEARNESS AND BRIGHTNESS FIRST AND THEN ON THE ORDER
THUS IN CHAUCER'S DREAM
IN BOTH THESE HIGH MYTHICAL SUBJECTS THE SURROUNDING NATURE THOUGH SUFFERING IS STILL DIGNIFIED AND BEAUTIFUL
EVERY LINE IN WHICH THE MASTER TRACES IT EVEN WHERE SEEMINGLY NEGLIGENT IS LOVELY AND SET DOWN WITH A MEDITATIVE CALMNESS WHICH MAKES THESE TWO ETCHINGS CAPABLE OF BEING PLACED BESIDE THE MOST TRANQUIL WORK OF HOLBEIN OR DUERER
BUT NOW HERE IS A SUBJECT OF WHICH YOU WILL WONDER AT FIRST WHY TURNER DREW IT AT ALL
IT HAS NO BEAUTY WHATSOEVER NO SPECIALTY OF PICTURESQUENESS AND ALL ITS LINES ARE CRAMPED AND POOR
THE CRAMPNESS AND THE POVERTY ARE ALL INTENDED
IT IS A GLEANER BRINGING DOWN HER ONE SHEAF OF CORN TO AN OLD WATERMILL ITSELF MOSSY AND RENT SCARCELY ABLE TO GET ITS STONES TO TURN
THE SCENE IS ABSOLUTELY ARCADIAN
SEE THAT YOUR LIVES BE IN NOTHING WORSE THAN A BOY'S CLIMBING FOR HIS ENTANGLED KITE
IT WILL BE WELL FOR YOU IF YOU JOIN NOT WITH THOSE WHO INSTEAD OF KITES FLY FALCONS WHO INSTEAD OF OBEYING THE LAST WORDS OF THE GREAT CLOUD SHEPHERD TO FEED HIS SHEEP LIVE THE LIVES HOW MUCH LESS THAN VANITY OF THE WAR WOLF AND THE GIER EAGLE
THE PARIS PLANT LIKE THAT AT THE CRYSTAL PALACE WAS A TEMPORARY EXHIBIT
THE LONDON PLANT WAS LESS TEMPORARY BUT NOT PERMANENT SUPPLYING BEFORE IT WAS TORN OUT NO FEWER THAN THREE THOUSAND LAMPS IN HOTELS CHURCHES STORES AND DWELLINGS IN THE VICINITY OF HOLBORN VIADUCT
THERE MESSRS JOHNSON AND HAMMER PUT INTO PRACTICE MANY OF THE IDEAS NOW STANDARD IN THE ART AND SECURED MUCH USEFUL DATA FOR THE WORK IN NEW YORK OF WHICH THE STORY HAS JUST BEEN TOLD
THE DYNAMO ELECTRIC MACHINE THOUGH SMALL WAS ROBUST FOR UNDER ALL THE VARYING SPEEDS OF WATER POWER AND THE VICISSITUDES OF THE PLANT TO WHICH IT BELONGED IT CONTINUED IN ACTIVE USE UNTIL EIGHTEEN NINETY NINE SEVENTEEN YEARS
OWING TO HIS INSISTENCE ON LOW PRESSURE DIRECT CURRENT FOR USE IN DENSELY POPULATED DISTRICTS AS THE ONLY SAFE AND TRULY UNIVERSAL PROFITABLE WAY OF DELIVERING ELECTRICAL ENERGY TO THE CONSUMERS EDISON HAS BEEN FREQUENTLY SPOKEN OF AS AN OPPONENT OF THE ALTERNATING CURRENT
WHY IF WE ERECT A STATION AT THE FALLS IT IS A GREAT ECONOMY TO GET IT UP TO THE CITY
THERE SEEMS NO GOOD REASON FOR BELIEVING THAT IT WILL CHANGE
BROAD AS THE PRAIRIES AND FREE IN THOUGHT AS THE WINDS THAT SWEEP THEM HE IS IDIOSYNCRATICALLY OPPOSED TO LOOSE AND WASTEFUL METHODS TO PLANS OF EMPIRE THAT NEGLECT THE POOR AT THE GATE
EVERYTHING HE HAS DONE HAS BEEN AIMED AT THE CONSERVATION OF ENERGY THE CONTRACTION OF SPACE THE INTENSIFICATION OF CULTURE
FOR SOME YEARS IT WAS NOT FOUND FEASIBLE TO OPERATE MOTORS ON ALTERNATING CURRENT CIRCUITS AND THAT REASON WAS OFTEN URGED AGAINST IT SERIOUSLY
IT COULD NOT BE USED FOR ELECTROPLATING OR DEPOSITION NOR COULD IT CHARGE STORAGE BATTERIES ALL OF WHICH ARE EASILY WITHIN THE ABILITY OF THE DIRECT CURRENT
BUT WHEN IT CAME TO BE A QUESTION OF LIGHTING A SCATTERED SUBURB A GROUP OF DWELLINGS ON THE OUTSKIRTS A REMOTE COUNTRY RESIDENCE OR A FARM HOUSE THE ALTERNATING CURRENT IN ALL ELEMENTS SAVE ITS DANGER WAS AND IS IDEAL
EDISON WAS INTOLERANT OF SHAM AND SHODDY AND NOTHING WOULD SATISFY HIM THAT COULD NOT STAND CROSS EXAMINATION BY MICROSCOPE TEST TUBE AND GALVANOMETER
UNLESS HE COULD SECURE AN ENGINE OF SMOOTHER RUNNING AND MORE EXACTLY GOVERNED AND REGULATED THAN THOSE AVAILABLE FOR HIS DYNAMO AND LAMP EDISON REALIZED THAT HE WOULD FIND IT ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO GIVE A STEADY LIGHT
MISTER EDISON WAS A LEADER FAR AHEAD OF THE TIME
HE OBTAINED THE DESIRED SPEED AND LOAD WITH A FRICTION BRAKE ALSO REGULATOR OF SPEED BUT WAITED FOR AN INDICATOR TO VERIFY IT
THEN AGAIN THERE WAS NO KNOWN WAY TO LUBRICATE AN ENGINE FOR CONTINUOUS RUNNING AND MISTER EDISON INFORMED ME THAT AS A MARINE ENGINE STARTED BEFORE THE SHIP LEFT NEW YORK AND CONTINUED RUNNING UNTIL IT REACHED ITS HOME PORT SO AN ENGINE FOR HIS PURPOSES MUST PRODUCE LIGHT AT ALL TIMES
EDISON HAD INSTALLED HIS HISTORIC FIRST GREAT CENTRAL STATION SYSTEM IN NEW YORK ON THE MULTIPLE ARC SYSTEM COVERED BY HIS FEEDER AND MAIN INVENTION WHICH RESULTED IN A NOTABLE SAVING IN THE COST OF CONDUCTORS AS AGAINST A STRAIGHT TWO WIRE SYSTEM THROUGHOUT OF THE TREE KIND
HE SOON FORESAW THAT STILL GREATER ECONOMY WOULD BE NECESSARY FOR COMMERCIAL SUCCESS NOT ALONE FOR THE LARGER TERRITORY OPENING BUT FOR THE COMPACT DISTRICTS OF LARGE CITIES
THE STRONG POSITION HELD BY THE EDISON SYSTEM UNDER THE STRENUOUS COMPETITION THAT WAS ALREADY SPRINGING UP WAS ENORMOUSLY IMPROVED BY THE INTRODUCTION OF THE THREE WIRE SYSTEM AND IT GAVE AN IMMEDIATE IMPETUS TO INCANDESCENT LIGHTING
IT WAS SPECIALLY SUITED FOR A TRIAL PLANT ALSO IN THE EARLY DAYS WHEN A YIELD OF SIX OR EIGHT LAMPS TO THE HORSE POWER WAS CONSIDERED SUBJECT FOR CONGRATULATION
THE STREET CONDUCTORS WERE OF THE OVERHEAD POLE LINE CONSTRUCTION AND WERE INSTALLED BY THE CONSTRUCTION COMPANY THAT HAD BEEN ORGANIZED BY EDISON TO BUILD AND EQUIP CENTRAL STATIONS
MEANWHILE HE HAD CALLED UPON ME TO MAKE A REPORT OF THE THREE WIRE SYSTEM KNOWN IN ENGLAND AS THE HOPKINSON BOTH DOCTOR JOHN HOPKINSON AND MISTER EDISON BEING INDEPENDENT INVENTORS AT PRACTICALLY THE SAME TIME
I THINK HE WAS PERHAPS MORE APPRECIATIVE THAN I WAS OF THE DISCIPLINE OF THE EDISON CONSTRUCTION DEPARTMENT AND THOUGHT IT WOULD BE WELL FOR US TO WAIT UNTIL THE MORNING OF THE FOURTH BEFORE WE STARTED UP
BUT THE PLANT RAN AND IT WAS THE FIRST THREE WIRE STATION IN THIS COUNTRY
THEY WERE LATER USED AS RESERVE MACHINES AND FINALLY WITH THE ENGINE RETIRED FROM SERVICE AS PART OF THE COLLECTION OF EDISONIA BUT THEY REMAIN IN PRACTICALLY AS GOOD CONDITION AS WHEN INSTALLED IN EIGHTEEN EIGHTY THREE
THE ARC LAMP INSTALLED OUTSIDE A CUSTOMER'S PREMISES OR IN A CIRCUIT FOR PUBLIC STREET LIGHTING BURNED SO MANY HOURS NIGHTLY SO MANY NIGHTS IN THE MONTH AND WAS PAID FOR AT THAT RATE SUBJECT TO REBATE FOR HOURS WHEN THE LAMP MIGHT BE OUT THROUGH ACCIDENT
EDISON HELD THAT THE ELECTRICITY SOLD MUST BE MEASURED JUST LIKE GAS OR WATER AND HE PROCEEDED TO DEVELOP A METER
THERE WAS INFINITE SCEPTICISM AROUND HIM ON THE SUBJECT AND WHILE OTHER INVENTORS WERE ALSO GIVING THE SUBJECT THEIR THOUGHT THE PUBLIC TOOK IT FOR GRANTED THAT ANYTHING SO UTTERLY INTANGIBLE AS ELECTRICITY THAT COULD NOT BE SEEN OR WEIGHED AND ONLY GAVE SECONDARY EVIDENCE OF ITSELF AT THE EXACT POINT OF USE COULD NOT BE BROUGHT TO ACCURATE REGISTRATION
HENCE THE EDISON ELECTROLYTIC METER IS NO LONGER USED DESPITE ITS EXCELLENT QUALITIES
THE PRINCIPLE EMPLOYED IN THE EDISON ELECTROLYTIC METER IS THAT WHICH EXEMPLIFIES THE POWER OF ELECTRICITY TO DECOMPOSE A CHEMICAL SUBSTANCE
ASSOCIATED WITH THIS SIMPLE FORM OF APPARATUS WERE VARIOUS INGENIOUS DETAILS AND REFINEMENTS TO SECURE REGULARITY OF OPERATION FREEDOM FROM INACCURACY AND IMMUNITY FROM SUCH TAMPERING AS WOULD PERMIT THEFT OF CURRENT OR DAMAGE
THE STANDARD EDISON METER PRACTICE WAS TO REMOVE THE CELLS ONCE A MONTH TO THE METER ROOM OF THE CENTRAL STATION COMPANY FOR EXAMINATION ANOTHER SET BEING SUBSTITUTED
IN DECEMBER EIGHTEEN EIGHTY EIGHT MISTER W J JENKS READ AN INTERESTING PAPER BEFORE THE AMERICAN INSTITUTE OF ELECTRICAL ENGINEERS ON THE SIX YEARS OF PRACTICAL EXPERIENCE HAD UP TO THAT TIME WITH THE METER THEN MORE GENERALLY IN USE THAN ANY OTHER
THE OTHERS HAVING BEEN IN OPERATION TOO SHORT A TIME TO SHOW DEFINITE RESULTS ALTHOUGH THEY ALSO WENT QUICKLY TO A DIVIDEND BASIS
IN THIS CONNECTION IT SHOULD BE MENTIONED THAT THE ASSOCIATION OF EDISON ILLUMINATING COMPANIES IN THE SAME YEAR ADOPTED RESOLUTIONS UNANIMOUSLY TO THE EFFECT THAT THE EDISON METER WAS ACCURATE AND THAT ITS USE WAS NOT EXPENSIVE FOR STATIONS ABOVE ONE THOUSAND LIGHTS AND THAT THE BEST FINANCIAL RESULTS WERE INVARIABLY SECURED IN A STATION SELLING CURRENT BY METER
THE METER CONTINUED IN GENERAL SERVICE DURING EIGHTEEN NINETY NINE AND PROBABLY UP TO THE CLOSE OF THE CENTURY
HE WEIGHED AND REWEIGHED THE METER PLATES AND PURSUED EVERY LINE OF INVESTIGATION IMAGINABLE BUT ALL IN VAIN
HE FELT HE WAS UP AGAINST IT AND THAT PERHAPS ANOTHER KIND OF A JOB WOULD SUIT HIM BETTER
THE PROBLEM WAS SOLVED
WE WERE MORE INTERESTED IN THE TECHNICAL CONDITION OF THE STATION THAN IN THE COMMERCIAL PART
WE HAD METERS IN WHICH THERE WERE TWO BOTTLES OF LIQUID
KENNETH AND BETH REFRAINED FROM TELLING THE OTHER GIRLS OR UNCLE JOHN OF OLD WILL ROGERS'S VISIT BUT THEY GOT MISTER WATSON IN THE LIBRARY AND QUESTIONED HIM CLOSELY ABOUT THE PENALTY FOR FORGING A CHECK
IT WAS A SERIOUS CRIME INDEED MISTER WATSON TOLD THEM AND TOM GATES BADE FAIR TO SERVE A LENGTHY TERM IN STATE'S PRISON AS A CONSEQUENCE OF HIS RASH ACT
I CAN'T SEE IT IN THAT LIGHT SAID THE OLD LAWYER
IT WAS A DELIBERATE THEFT FROM HIS EMPLOYERS TO PROTECT A GIRL HE LOVED
BUT THEY COULD NOT HAVE PROVEN A CASE AGAINST LUCY IF SHE WAS INNOCENT AND ALL THEIR THREATS OF ARRESTING HER WERE PROBABLY MERE BLUFF
HE WAS SOFT HEARTED AND IMPETUOUS SAID BETH AND BEING IN LOVE HE DIDN'T STOP TO COUNT THE COST
IF THE PROSECUTION WERE WITHDRAWN AND THE CASE SETTLED WITH THE VICTIM OF THE FORGED CHECK THEN THE YOUNG MAN WOULD BE ALLOWED HIS FREEDOM
BUT UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES I DOUBT IF SUCH AN ARRANGEMENT COULD BE MADE
FAIRVIEW WAS TWELVE MILES AWAY BUT BY TEN O'CLOCK THEY DREW UP AT THE COUNTY JAIL
THEY WERE RECEIVED IN THE LITTLE OFFICE BY A MAN NAMED MARKHAM WHO WAS THE JAILER
WE WISH TO TALK WITH HIM ANSWERED KENNETH TALK
I'M RUNNING FOR REPRESENTATIVE ON THE REPUBLICAN TICKET SAID KENNETH QUIETLY
OH SAY THAT'S DIFFERENT OBSERVED MARKHAM ALTERING HIS DEMEANOR
MAY WE SEE GATES AT ONCE ASKED KENNETH
THEY FOLLOWED THE JAILER ALONG A SUCCESSION OF PASSAGES
SOMETIMES I'M THAT YEARNING FOR A SMOKE I'M NEARLY CRAZY AN I DUNNO WHICH IS WORST DYIN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER
HE UNLOCKED THE DOOR AND CALLED HERE'S VISITORS TOM
WORSE TOM WORSE N EVER REPLIED THE JAILER GLOOMILY
MISS DE GRAF SAID KENNETH NOTICING THE BOY'S FACE CRITICALLY AS HE STOOD WHERE THE LIGHT FROM THE PASSAGE FELL UPON IT
SORRY WE HAVEN'T ANY RECEPTION ROOM IN THE JAIL
SIT DOWN PLEASE SAID GATES IN A CHEERFUL AND PLEASANT VOICE THERE'S A BENCH HERE
A FRESH WHOLESOME LOOKING BOY WAS TOM GATES WITH STEADY GRAY EYES AN INTELLIGENT FOREHEAD BUT A SENSITIVE RATHER WEAK MOUTH
WE HAVE HEARD SOMETHING OF YOUR STORY SAID KENNETH AND ARE INTERESTED IN IT
I DIDN'T STOP TO THINK WHETHER IT WAS FOOLISH OR NOT I DID IT AND I'M GLAD I DID
OLD WILL IS A FINE FELLOW BUT POOR AND HELPLESS SINCE MISSUS ROGERS HAD HER ACCIDENT
THEN ROGERS WOULDN'T DO ANYTHING BUT LEAD HER AROUND AND WAIT UPON HER AND THE PLACE WENT TO RACK AND RUIN
HE SPOKE SIMPLY BUT PACED UP AND DOWN THE NARROW CELL IN FRONT OF THEM
WHOSE NAME DID YOU SIGN TO THE CHECK ASKED KENNETH
HE IS SUPPOSED TO SIGN ALL THE CHECKS OF THE CONCERN
IT'S A STOCK COMPANY AND RICH
I WAS BOOKKEEPER SO IT WAS EASY TO GET A BLANK CHECK AND FORGE THE SIGNATURE
AS REGARDS MY ROBBING THE COMPANY I'LL SAY THAT I SAVED THEM A HEAVY LOSS ONE DAY
I DISCOVERED AND PUT OUT A FIRE THAT WOULD HAVE DESTROYED THE WHOLE PLANT BUT MARSHALL NEVER EVEN THANKED ME
IT WAS BETTER FOR HIM TO THINK THE GIRL UNFEELING THAN TO KNOW THE TRUTH
I'M GOING TO SEE MISTER MARSHALL SAID KENNETH AND DISCOVER WHAT I CAN DO TO ASSIST YOU THANK YOU SIR
IT WON'T BE MUCH BUT I'M GRATEFUL TO FIND A FRIEND
THEY LEFT HIM THEN FOR THE JAILER ARRIVED TO UNLOCK THE DOOR AND ESCORT THEM TO THE OFFICE
I'VE SEEN LOTS OF THAT KIND IN MY DAY
AND IT RUINS A MAN'S DISPOSITION
HE LOOKED UP RATHER UNGRACIOUSLY BUT MOTIONED THEM TO BE SEATED
SOME GIRL HAS BEEN HERE TWICE TO INTERVIEW MY MEN AND I HAVE REFUSED TO ADMIT HER
I'M NOT ELECTIONEERING JUST NOW
OH WELL SIR WHAT ABOUT HIM
AND HE DESERVES A TERM IN STATE'S PRISON
IT HAS COST ME TWICE SIXTY DOLLARS IN ANNOYANCE
I'LL PAY ALL THE COSTS BESIDES
YOU'RE FOOLISH WHY SHOULD YOU DO ALL THIS
I HAVE MY OWN REASONS MISTER MARSHALL
GIVE ME A CHECK FOR A HUNDRED AND FIFTY AND I'LL TURN OVER TO YOU THE FORGED CHECK AND QUASH FURTHER PROCEEDINGS
HE DETESTED THE GRASPING DISPOSITION THAT WOULD ENDEAVOR TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF HIS EVIDENT DESIRE TO HELP YOUNG GATES
BETH UNEASY AT HIS SILENCE NUDGED HIM
THERE WAS A GRIM SMILE OF AMUSEMENT ON HIS SHREWD FACE
HE MIGHT HAVE HAD THAT FORGED CHECK FOR THE FACE OF IT IF HE'D BEEN SHARP
AND TO THINK WE CAN SAVE ALL THAT MISERY AND DESPAIR BY THE PAYMENT OF A HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS
SO TO THE SURPRISE OF THE DEMOCRATIC COMMITTEE AND ALL HIS FRIENDS MISTER HOPKINS ANNOUNCED THAT HE WOULD OPPOSE FORBES'S AGGRESSIVE CAMPAIGN WITH AN EQUAL AGGRESSIVENESS AND SPEND AS MANY DOLLARS IN DOING SO AS MIGHT BE NECESSARY
ONE OF MISTER HOPKINS'S FIRST TASKS AFTER CALLING HIS FAITHFUL HENCHMEN AROUND HIM WAS TO MAKE A CAREFUL CANVASS OF THE VOTERS OF HIS DISTRICT TO SEE WHAT WAS STILL TO BE ACCOMPLISHED
THE WEAK KNEED CONTINGENCY MUST BE STRENGTHENED AND FORTIFIED AND A COUPLE OF HUNDRED VOTES IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER SECURED FROM THE OPPOSITION
THE DEMOCRATIC COMMITTEE FIGURED OUT A WAY TO DO THIS
UNDER ORDINARY CONDITIONS REYNOLDS WAS SURE TO BE ELECTED BUT THE COMMITTEE PROPOSED TO SACRIFICE HIM IN ORDER TO ELECT HOPKINS
THE ONLY THING NECESSARY WAS TO FIX SETH REYNOLDS AND THIS HOPKINS ARRANGED PERSONALLY
AND THIS WAS WHY KENNETH AND BETH DISCOVERED HIM CONVERSING WITH THE YOUNG WOMAN IN THE BUGGY
THE DESCRIPTION SHE GAVE OF THE COMING RECEPTION TO THE WOMAN'S POLITICAL LEAGUE WAS SO HUMOROUS AND DIVERTING THAT THEY WERE BOTH LAUGHING HEARTILY OVER THE THING WHEN THE YOUNG PEOPLE PASSED THEM AND THUS MISTER HOPKINS FAILED TO NOTICE WHO THE OCCUPANTS OF THE OTHER VEHICLE WERE
THESE WOMEN WERE FLATTERED BY THE ATTENTION OF THE YOUNG LADY AND HAD PROMISED TO ASSIST IN ELECTING MISTER FORBES
LOUISE HOPED FOR EXCELLENT RESULTS FROM THIS ORGANIZATION AND WISHED THE ENTERTAINMENT TO BE SO EFFECTIVE IN WINNING THEIR GOOD WILL THAT THEY WOULD WORK EARNESTLY FOR THE CAUSE IN WHICH THEY WERE ENLISTED
THE FAIRVIEW BAND WAS ENGAGED TO DISCOURSE AS MUCH HARMONY AS IT COULD PRODUCE AND THE RESOURCES OF THE GREAT HOUSE WERE TAXED TO ENTERTAIN THE GUESTS
TABLES WERE SPREAD ON THE LAWN AND A DAINTY BUT SUBSTANTIAL REPAST WAS TO BE SERVED
THIS WAS THE FIRST OCCASION WITHIN A GENERATION WHEN SUCH AN ENTERTAINMENT HAD BEEN GIVEN AT ELMHURST AND THE ONLY ONE WITHIN THE MEMORY OF MAN WHERE THE NEIGHBORS AND COUNTRY PEOPLE HAD BEEN INVITED GUESTS
THE ATTENDANCE WAS UNEXPECTEDLY LARGE AND THE GIRLS WERE DELIGHTED FORESEEING GREAT SUCCESS FOR THEIR FETE
WE OUGHT TO HAVE MORE ATTENDANTS BETH SAID LOUISE APPROACHING HER COUSIN
WON'T YOU RUN INTO THE HOUSE AND SEE IF MARTHA CAN'T SPARE ONE OR TWO MORE MAIDS
SHE WAS VERY FOND OF THE YOUNG LADIES WHOM SHE HAD KNOWN WHEN AUNT JANE WAS THE MISTRESS HERE AND BETH WAS HER ESPECIAL FAVORITE
THE HOUSEKEEPER LED THE WAY AND BETH FOLLOWED
FOR A MOMENT BETH STOOD STARING WHILE THE NEW MAID REGARDED HER WITH COMPOSURE AND A SLIGHT SMILE UPON HER BEAUTIFUL FACE
SHE WAS DRESSED IN THE REGULATION COSTUME OF THE MAIDS AT ELMHURST A PLAIN BLACK GOWN WITH WHITE APRON AND CAP
THEN SHE GAVE A LITTLE LAUGH AND REPLIED NO MISS BETH I'M ELIZABETH PARSONS
BUT IT CAN'T BE PROTESTED THE GIRL
I ATTEND TO THE HOUSEHOLD MENDING YOU KNOW AND CARE FOR THE LINEN
YOU SPEAK LIKE AN EDUCATED PERSON SAID BETH WONDERINGLY WHERE IS YOUR HOME
FOR THE FIRST TIME THE MAID SEEMED A LITTLE CONFUSED AND HER GAZE WANDERED FROM THE FACE OF HER VISITOR
SHE SAT DOWN IN A ROCKING CHAIR AND CLASPING HER HANDS IN HER LAP ROCKED SLOWLY BACK AND FORTH I'M SORRY SAID BETH
ELIZA PARSONS SHOOK HER HEAD
THEY THEY EXCITE ME IN SOME WAY AND I I CAN'T BEAR THEM YOU MUST EXCUSE ME
SHE EVEN SEEMED MILDLY AMUSED AT THE ATTENTION SHE ATTRACTED
BETH WAS A BEAUTIFUL GIRL THE HANDSOMEST OF THE THREE COUSINS BY FAR YET ELIZA SURPASSED HER IN NATURAL CHARM AND SEEMED WELL AWARE OF THE FACT
HER MANNER WAS NEITHER INDEPENDENT NOR ASSERTIVE BUT RATHER ONE OF WELL BRED COMPOSURE AND CALM RELIANCE
HER EYES WANDERED TO THE MAID'S HANDS
HOWEVER HER FEATURES AND FORM MIGHT REPRESS ANY EVIDENCE OF NERVOUSNESS THESE HANDS TOLD A DIFFERENT STORY
SHE ROSE QUICKLY TO HER FEET WITH AN IMPETUOUS GESTURE THAT MADE HER VISITOR CATCH HER BREATH
I WISH I KNEW MYSELF SHE CRIED FIERCELY
WILL YOU LEAVE ME ALONE IN MY OWN ROOM OR MUST I GO AWAY TO ESCAPE YOU
ELIZA CLOSED THE DOOR BEHIND HER WITH A DECIDED SLAM AND A KEY CLICKED IN THE LOCK
I WILL ENDEAVOUR IN MY STATEMENT TO AVOID SUCH TERMS AS WOULD SERVE TO LIMIT THE EVENTS TO ANY PARTICULAR PLACE OR GIVE A CLUE AS TO THE PEOPLE CONCERNED
I HAD ALWAYS KNOWN HIM TO BE RESTLESS IN HIS MANNER BUT ON THIS PARTICULAR OCCASION HE WAS IN SUCH A STATE OF UNCONTROLLABLE AGITATION THAT IT WAS CLEAR SOMETHING VERY UNUSUAL HAD OCCURRED
MY FRIEND'S TEMPER HAD NOT IMPROVED SINCE HE HAD BEEN DEPRIVED OF THE CONGENIAL SURROUNDINGS OF BAKER STREET
WITHOUT HIS SCRAPBOOKS HIS CHEMICALS AND HIS HOMELY UNTIDINESS HE WAS AN UNCOMFORTABLE MAN
I HAD TO READ IT OVER CAREFULLY AS THE TEXT MUST BE ABSOLUTELY CORRECT
I WAS ABSENT RATHER MORE THAN AN HOUR
THE ONLY DUPLICATE WHICH EXISTED SO FAR AS I KNEW WAS THAT WHICH BELONGED TO MY SERVANT BANNISTER A MAN WHO HAS LOOKED AFTER MY ROOM FOR TEN YEARS AND WHOSE HONESTY IS ABSOLUTELY ABOVE SUSPICION
THE MOMENT I LOOKED AT MY TABLE I WAS AWARE THAT SOMEONE HAD RUMMAGED AMONG MY PAPERS
THE PROOF WAS IN THREE LONG SLIPS I HAD LEFT THEM ALL TOGETHER
THE ALTERNATIVE WAS THAT SOMEONE PASSING HAD OBSERVED THE KEY IN THE DOOR HAD KNOWN THAT I WAS OUT AND HAD ENTERED TO LOOK AT THE PAPERS
I GAVE HIM A LITTLE BRANDY AND LEFT HIM COLLAPSED IN A CHAIR WHILE I MADE A MOST CAREFUL EXAMINATION OF THE ROOM
A BROKEN TIP OF LEAD WAS LYING THERE ALSO
NOT ONLY THIS BUT ON THE TABLE I FOUND A SMALL BALL OF BLACK DOUGH OR CLAY WITH SPECKS OF SOMETHING WHICH LOOKS LIKE SAWDUST IN IT
ABOVE ALL THINGS I DESIRE TO SETTLE THE MATTER QUIETLY AND DISCREETLY
TO THE BEST OF MY BELIEF THEY WERE ROLLED UP
DID ANYONE KNOW THAT THESE PROOFS WOULD BE THERE NO ONE SAVE THE PRINTER
I WAS IN SUCH A HURRY TO COME TO YOU YOU LEFT YOUR DOOR OPEN
SO IT SEEMS TO ME
NOW MISTER SOAMES AT YOUR DISPOSAL
ABOVE WERE THREE STUDENTS ONE ON EACH STORY
THEN HE APPROACHED IT AND STANDING ON TIPTOE WITH HIS NECK CRANED HE LOOKED INTO THE ROOM
THERE IS NO OPENING EXCEPT THE ONE PANE SAID OUR LEARNED GUIDE
I AM AFRAID THERE ARE NO SIGNS HERE SAID HE
ONE COULD HARDLY HOPE FOR ANY UPON SO DRY A DAY
YOU LEFT HIM IN A CHAIR YOU SAY WHICH CHAIR BY THE WINDOW THERE
THE MAN ENTERED AND TOOK THE PAPERS SHEET BY SHEET FROM THE CENTRAL TABLE
AS A MATTER OF FACT HE COULD NOT SAID SOAMES FOR I ENTERED BY THE SIDE DOOR
HOW LONG WOULD IT TAKE HIM TO DO THAT USING EVERY POSSIBLE CONTRACTION A QUARTER OF AN HOUR NOT LESS
THEN HE TOSSED IT DOWN AND SEIZED THE NEXT
HE WAS IN THE MIDST OF THAT WHEN YOUR RETURN CAUSED HIM TO MAKE A VERY HURRIED RETREAT VERY HURRIED SINCE HE HAD NOT TIME TO REPLACE THE PAPERS WHICH WOULD TELL YOU THAT HE HAD BEEN THERE
MISTER SOAMES WAS SOMEWHAT OVERWHELMED BY THIS FLOOD OF INFORMATION
HOLMES HELD OUT A SMALL CHIP WITH THE LETTERS N N AND A SPACE OF CLEAR WOOD AFTER THEM YOU SEE
WATSON I HAVE ALWAYS DONE YOU AN INJUSTICE THERE ARE OTHERS
I WAS HOPING THAT IF THE PAPER ON WHICH HE WROTE WAS THIN SOME TRACE OF IT MIGHT COME THROUGH UPON THIS POLISHED SURFACE NO I SEE NOTHING
AS HOLMES DREW THE CURTAIN I WAS AWARE FROM SOME LITTLE RIGIDITY AND ALERTNESS OF HIS ATTITUDE THAT HE WAS PREPARED FOR AN EMERGENCY
HOLMES TURNED AWAY AND STOOPED SUDDENLY TO THE FLOOR HALLOA WHAT'S THIS
HOLMES HELD IT OUT ON HIS OPEN PALM IN THE GLARE OF THE ELECTRIC LIGHT
WHAT COULD HE DO HE CAUGHT UP EVERYTHING WHICH WOULD BETRAY HIM AND HE RUSHED INTO YOUR BEDROOM TO CONCEAL HIMSELF
I UNDERSTAND YOU TO SAY THAT THERE ARE THREE STUDENTS WHO USE THIS STAIR AND ARE IN THE HABIT OF PASSING YOUR DOOR YES THERE ARE
AND THEY ARE ALL IN FOR THIS EXAMINATION YES
ONE HARDLY LIKES TO THROW SUSPICION WHERE THERE ARE NO PROOFS
LET US HEAR THE SUSPICIONS I WILL LOOK AFTER THE PROOFS
MY SCHOLAR HAS BEEN LEFT VERY POOR BUT HE IS HARD WORKING AND INDUSTRIOUS HE WILL DO WELL
THE TOP FLOOR BELONGS TO MILES MC LAREN
I DARE NOT GO SO FAR AS THAT BUT OF THE THREE HE IS PERHAPS THE LEAST UNLIKELY
HE WAS STILL SUFFERING FROM THIS SUDDEN DISTURBANCE OF THE QUIET ROUTINE OF HIS LIFE
BUT I HAVE OCCASIONALLY DONE THE SAME THING AT OTHER TIMES
DID YOU LOOK AT THESE PAPERS ON THE TABLE
HOW CAME YOU TO LEAVE THE KEY IN THE DOOR
ANYONE IN THE ROOM COULD GET OUT YES SIR
I REALLY DON'T THINK HE KNEW MUCH ABOUT IT MISTER HOLMES
ONLY FOR A MINUTE OR SO
OH I WOULD NOT VENTURE TO SAY SIR
YOU HAVEN'T SEEN ANY OF THEM NO SIR
IT WAS THE INDIAN WHOSE DARK SILHOUETTE APPEARED SUDDENLY UPON HIS BLIND
HE WAS PACING SWIFTLY UP AND DOWN HIS ROOM
THIS SET OF ROOMS IS QUITE THE OLDEST IN THE COLLEGE AND IT IS NOT UNUSUAL FOR VISITORS TO GO OVER THEM
NO NAMES PLEASE SAID HOLMES AS WE KNOCKED AT GILCHRIST'S DOOR
OF COURSE HE DID NOT REALIZE THAT IT WAS I WHO WAS KNOCKING BUT NONE THE LESS HIS CONDUCT WAS VERY UNCOURTEOUS AND INDEED UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES RATHER SUSPICIOUS
THAT IS VERY IMPORTANT SAID HOLMES
YOU DON'T SEEM TO REALIZE THE POSITION
TO MORROW IS THE EXAMINATION
I CANNOT ALLOW THE EXAMINATION TO BE HELD IF ONE OF THE PAPERS HAS BEEN TAMPERED WITH THE SITUATION MUST BE FACED
IT IS POSSIBLE THAT I MAY BE IN A POSITION THEN TO INDICATE SOME COURSE OF ACTION
I WILL TAKE THE BLACK CLAY WITH ME ALSO THE PENCIL CUTTINGS GOOD BYE
WHEN WE WERE OUT IN THE DARKNESS OF THE QUADRANGLE WE AGAIN LOOKED UP AT THE WINDOWS
THE FOUL MOUTHED FELLOW AT THE TOP
HE IS THE ONE WITH THE WORST RECORD
WHY BANNISTER THE SERVANT WHAT'S HIS GAME IN THE MATTER
HE IMPRESSED ME AS BEING A PERFECTLY HONEST MAN
MY FRIEND DID NOT APPEAR TO BE DEPRESSED BY HIS FAILURE BUT SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS IN HALF HUMOROUS RESIGNATION
NO GOOD MY DEAR WATSON
I THINK SO YOU HAVE FORMED A CONCLUSION
YES MY DEAR WATSON I HAVE SOLVED THE MYSTERY
LOOK AT THAT HE HELD OUT HIS HAND
ON THE PALM WERE THREE LITTLE PYRAMIDS OF BLACK DOUGHY CLAY
AND ONE MORE THIS MORNING
IN A FEW HOURS THE EXAMINATION WOULD COMMENCE AND HE WAS STILL IN THE DILEMMA BETWEEN MAKING THE FACTS PUBLIC AND ALLOWING THE CULPRIT TO COMPETE FOR THE VALUABLE SCHOLARSHIP
HE COULD HARDLY STAND STILL SO GREAT WAS HIS MENTAL AGITATION AND HE RAN TOWARDS HOLMES WITH TWO EAGER HANDS OUTSTRETCHED THANK HEAVEN THAT YOU HAVE COME
YOU KNOW HIM I THINK SO
IF THIS MATTER IS NOT TO BECOME PUBLIC WE MUST GIVE OURSELVES CERTAIN POWERS AND RESOLVE OURSELVES INTO A SMALL PRIVATE COURT MARTIAL
NO SIR CERTAINLY NOT
THERE WAS NO MAN SIR
HIS TROUBLED BLUE EYES GLANCED AT EACH OF US AND FINALLY RESTED WITH AN EXPRESSION OF BLANK DISMAY UPON BANNISTER IN THE FARTHER CORNER
JUST CLOSE THE DOOR SAID HOLMES
WE WANT TO KNOW MISTER GILCHRIST HOW YOU AN HONOURABLE MAN EVER CAME TO COMMIT SUCH AN ACTION AS THAT OF YESTERDAY
FOR A MOMENT GILCHRIST WITH UPRAISED HAND TRIED TO CONTROL HIS WRITHING FEATURES
COME COME SAID HOLMES KINDLY IT IS HUMAN TO ERR AND AT LEAST NO ONE CAN ACCUSE YOU OF BEING A CALLOUS CRIMINAL
WELL WELL DON'T TROUBLE TO ANSWER LISTEN AND SEE THAT I DO YOU NO INJUSTICE
HE COULD EXAMINE THE PAPERS IN HIS OWN OFFICE
THE INDIAN I ALSO THOUGHT NOTHING OF
WHEN I APPROACHED YOUR ROOM I EXAMINED THE WINDOW
NO ONE LESS THAN THAT WOULD HAVE A CHANCE
I ENTERED AND I TOOK YOU INTO MY CONFIDENCE AS TO THE SUGGESTIONS OF THE SIDE TABLE
HE RETURNED CARRYING HIS JUMPING SHOES WHICH ARE PROVIDED AS YOU ARE AWARE WITH SEVERAL SHARP SPIKES
NO HARM WOULD HAVE BEEN DONE HAD IT NOT BEEN THAT AS HE PASSED YOUR DOOR HE PERCEIVED THE KEY WHICH HAD BEEN LEFT BY THE CARELESSNESS OF YOUR SERVANT
A SUDDEN IMPULSE CAME OVER HIM TO ENTER AND SEE IF THEY WERE INDEED THE PROOFS
HE PUT HIS SHOES ON THE TABLE
GLOVES SAID THE YOUNG MAN
SUDDENLY HE HEARD HIM AT THE VERY DOOR THERE WAS NO POSSIBLE ESCAPE
HAVE I TOLD THE TRUTH MISTER GILCHRIST
I HAVE A LETTER HERE MISTER SOAMES WHICH I WROTE TO YOU EARLY THIS MORNING IN THE MIDDLE OF A RESTLESS NIGHT
IT WILL BE CLEAR TO YOU FROM WHAT I HAVE SAID THAT ONLY YOU COULD HAVE LET THIS YOUNG MAN OUT SINCE YOU WERE LEFT IN THE ROOM AND MUST HAVE LOCKED THE DOOR WHEN YOU WENT OUT
IT WAS SIMPLE ENOUGH SIR IF YOU ONLY HAD KNOWN BUT WITH ALL YOUR CLEVERNESS IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE THAT YOU COULD KNOW
IF MISTER SOAMES SAW THEM THE GAME WAS UP
SHE WAS TIRED OF OTHER THINGS
SHE TRIED THIS MORNING AN AIR OR TWO UPON THE PIANO SANG A SIMPLE SONG IN A SWEET BUT SLIGHTLY METALLIC VOICE AND THEN SEATING HERSELF BY THE OPEN WINDOW READ PHILIP'S LETTER
WELL MOTHER SAID THE YOUNG STUDENT LOOKING UP WITH A SHADE OF IMPATIENCE
I HOPE THEE TOLD THE ELDERS THAT FATHER AND I ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE PIANO AND THAT MUCH AS THEE LOVES MUSIC THEE IS NEVER IN THE ROOM WHEN IT IS PLAYED
I HEARD FATHER TELL COUSIN ABNER THAT HE WAS WHIPPED SO OFTEN FOR WHISTLING WHEN HE WAS A BOY THAT HE WAS DETERMINED TO HAVE WHAT COMPENSATION HE COULD GET NOW
THY WAYS GREATLY TRY ME RUTH AND ALL THY RELATIONS
IS THY FATHER WILLING THEE SHOULD GO AWAY TO A SCHOOL OF THE WORLD'S PEOPLE
I HAVE NOT ASKED HIM RUTH REPLIED WITH A LOOK THAT MIGHT IMPLY THAT SHE WAS ONE OF THOSE DETERMINED LITTLE BODIES WHO FIRST MADE UP HER OWN MIND AND THEN COMPELLED OTHERS TO MAKE UP THEIRS IN ACCORDANCE WITH HERS
MOTHER I'M GOING TO STUDY MEDICINE
MARGARET BOLTON ALMOST LOST FOR A MOMENT HER HABITUAL PLACIDITY
THEE STUDY MEDICINE
DOES THEE THINK THEE COULD STAND IT SIX MONTHS
AND BESIDES SUPPOSE THEE DOES LEARN MEDICINE
I WILL PRACTICE IT
WHERE THEE AND THY FAMILY ARE KNOWN
IF I CAN GET PATIENTS
RUTH SAT QUITE STILL FOR A TIME WITH FACE INTENT AND FLUSHED IT WAS OUT NOW
THE SIGHT SEERS RETURNED IN HIGH SPIRITS FROM THE CITY
RUTH ASKED THE ENTHUSIASTS IF THEY WOULD LIKE TO LIVE IN SUCH A SOUNDING MAUSOLEUM WITH ITS GREAT HALLS AND ECHOING ROOMS AND NO COMFORTABLE PLACE IN IT FOR THE ACCOMMODATION OF ANY BODY
AND THEN THERE WAS BROAD STREET
THERE CERTAINLY WAS NO END TO IT AND EVEN RUTH WAS PHILADELPHIAN ENOUGH TO BELIEVE THAT A STREET OUGHT NOT TO HAVE ANY END OR ARCHITECTURAL POINT UPON WHICH THE WEARY EYE COULD REST
BUT NEITHER SAINT GIRARD NOR BROAD STREET NEITHER WONDERS OF THE MINT NOR THE GLORIES OF THE HALL WHERE THE GHOSTS OF OUR FATHERS SIT ALWAYS SIGNING THE DECLARATION IMPRESSED THE VISITORS SO MUCH AS THE SPLENDORS OF THE CHESTNUT STREET WINDOWS AND THE BARGAINS ON EIGHTH STREET
IS THEE GOING TO THE YEARLY MEETING RUTH ASKED ONE OF THE GIRLS
I HAVE NOTHING TO WEAR REPLIED THAT DEMURE PERSON
IT HAS OCCUPIED MOTHER A LONG TIME TO FIND AT THE SHOPS THE EXACT SHADE FOR HER NEW BONNET
AND THEE WON'T GO WHY SHOULD I
IF I GO TO MEETING AT ALL I LIKE BEST TO SIT IN THE QUIET OLD HOUSE IN GERMANTOWN WHERE THE WINDOWS ARE ALL OPEN AND I CAN SEE THE TREES AND HEAR THE STIR OF THE LEAVES
IT'S SUCH A CRUSH AT THE YEARLY MEETING AT ARCH STREET AND THEN THERE'S THE ROW OF SLEEK LOOKING YOUNG MEN WHO LINE THE CURBSTONE AND STARE AT US AS WE COME OUT
HE DOESN'T SAY BUT IT'S ON THE FRONTIER AND ON THE MAP EVERYTHING BEYOND IT IS MARKED INDIANS AND DESERT AND LOOKS AS DESOLATE AS A WEDNESDAY MEETING HUMPH IT WAS TIME FOR HIM TO DO SOMETHING
IS HE GOING TO START A DAILY NEWSPAPER AMONG THE KICK A POOS
FATHER THEE'S UNJUST TO PHILIP HE'S GOING INTO BUSINESS
HE DOESN'T SAY EXACTLY WHAT IT IS SAID RUTH A LITTLE DUBIOUSLY BUT IT'S SOMETHING ABOUT LAND AND RAILROADS AND THEE KNOWS FATHER THAT FORTUNES ARE MADE NOBODY KNOWS EXACTLY HOW IN A NEW COUNTRY
BUT PHILIP IS HONEST AND HE HAS TALENT ENOUGH IF HE WILL STOP SCRIBBLING TO MAKE HIS WAY
WHAT A BOX WOMEN ARE PUT INTO MEASURED FOR IT AND PUT IN YOUNG IF WE GO ANYWHERE IT'S IN A BOX VEILED AND PINIONED AND SHUT IN BY DISABILITIES
WHY SHOULD I RUST AND BE STUPID AND SIT IN INACTION BECAUSE I AM A GIRL
AND IF I HAD A FORTUNE WOULD THEE WANT ME TO LEAD A USELESS LIFE
HAS THEE CONSULTED THY MOTHER ABOUT A CAREER I SUPPOSE IT IS A CAREER THEE WANTS
BUT THAT WISE AND PLACID WOMAN UNDERSTOOD THE SWEET REBEL A GREAT DEAL BETTER THAN RUTH UNDERSTOOD HERSELF
RUTH WAS GLAD TO HEAR THAT PHILIP HAD MADE A PUSH INTO THE WORLD AND SHE WAS SURE THAT HIS TALENT AND COURAGE WOULD MAKE A WAY FOR HIM
YOU'LL NEVER DIG IT OUT OF THE ASTOR LIBRARY
TO THE YOUNG AMERICAN HERE OR ELSEWHERE THE PATHS TO FORTUNE ARE INNUMERABLE AND ALL OPEN THERE IS INVITATION IN THE AIR AND SUCCESS IN ALL HIS WIDE HORIZON
HE HAS NO TRADITIONS TO BIND HIM OR GUIDE HIM AND HIS IMPULSE IS TO BREAK AWAY FROM THE OCCUPATION HIS FATHER HAS FOLLOWED AND MAKE A NEW WAY FOR HIMSELF
THE MODEST FELLOW WOULD HAVE LIKED FAME THRUST UPON HIM FOR SOME WORTHY ACHIEVEMENT IT MIGHT BE FOR A BOOK OR FOR THE SKILLFUL MANAGEMENT OF SOME GREAT NEWSPAPER OR FOR SOME DARING EXPEDITION LIKE THAT OF LIEUTENANT STRAIN OR DOCTOR KANE
HE WAS UNABLE TO DECIDE EXACTLY WHAT IT SHOULD BE
SOMETIMES HE THOUGHT HE WOULD LIKE TO STAND IN A CONSPICUOUS PULPIT AND HUMBLY PREACH THE GOSPEL OF REPENTANCE AND IT EVEN CROSSED HIS MIND THAT IT WOULD BE NOBLE TO GIVE HIMSELF TO A MISSIONARY LIFE TO SOME BENIGHTED REGION WHERE THE DATE PALM GROWS AND THE NIGHTINGALE'S VOICE IS IN TUNE AND THE BUL BUL SINGS ON THE OFF NIGHTS
LAW SEEMED TO HIM WELL ENOUGH AS A SCIENCE BUT HE NEVER COULD DISCOVER A PRACTICAL CASE WHERE IT APPEARED TO HIM WORTH WHILE TO GO TO LAW AND ALL THE CLIENTS WHO STOPPED WITH THIS NEW CLERK IN THE ANTE ROOM OF THE LAW OFFICE WHERE HE WAS WRITING PHILIP INVARIABLY ADVISED TO SETTLE NO MATTER HOW BUT SETTLE GREATLY TO THE DISGUST OF HIS EMPLOYER WHO KNEW THAT JUSTICE BETWEEN MAN AND MAN COULD ONLY BE ATTAINED BY THE RECOGNIZED PROCESSES WITH THE ATTENDANT FEES
IT IS SUCH A NOBLE AMBITION THAT IT IS A PITY IT HAS USUALLY SUCH A SHALLOW FOUNDATION
HE WANTED TO BEGIN AT THE TOP OF THE LADDER
PHILIP THEREFORE READ DILIGENTLY IN THE ASTOR LIBRARY PLANNED LITERARY WORKS THAT SHOULD COMPEL ATTENTION AND NURSED HIS GENIUS
HE HAD NO FRIEND WISE ENOUGH TO TELL HIM TO STEP INTO THE DORKING CONVENTION THEN IN SESSION MAKE A SKETCH OF THE MEN AND WOMEN ON THE PLATFORM AND TAKE IT TO THE EDITOR OF THE DAILY GRAPEVINE AND SEE WHAT HE COULD GET A LINE FOR IT
O VERY WELL SAID GRINGO TURNING AWAY WITH A SHADE OF CONTEMPT YOU'LL FIND IF YOU ARE GOING INTO LITERATURE AND NEWSPAPER WORK THAT YOU CAN'T AFFORD A CONSCIENCE LIKE THAT
BUT PHILIP DID AFFORD IT AND HE WROTE THANKING HIS FRIENDS AND DECLINING BECAUSE HE SAID THE POLITICAL SCHEME WOULD FAIL AND OUGHT TO FAIL
AND HE WENT BACK TO HIS BOOKS AND TO HIS WAITING FOR AN OPENING LARGE ENOUGH FOR HIS DIGNIFIED ENTRANCE INTO THE LITERARY WORLD
WELL I'M GOING AS AN ENGINEER YOU CAN GO AS ONE
YOU CAN BEGIN BY CARRYING A ROD AND PUTTING DOWN THE FIGURES
NO ITS NOT TOO SOON
I'VE BEEN READY TO GO ANYWHERE FOR SIX MONTHS
THE TWO YOUNG MEN WHO WERE BY THIS TIME FULL OF THE ADVENTURE WENT DOWN TO THE WALL STREET OFFICE OF HENRY'S UNCLE AND HAD A TALK WITH THAT WILY OPERATOR
THE NIGHT WAS SPENT IN PACKING UP AND WRITING LETTERS FOR PHILIP WOULD NOT TAKE SUCH AN IMPORTANT STEP WITHOUT INFORMING HIS FRIENDS
WHY IT'S IN MISSOURI SOMEWHERE ON THE FRONTIER I THINK WE'LL GET A MAP
I WAS AFRAID IT WAS NEARER HOME
HE KNEW HIS UNCLE WOULD BE GLAD TO HEAR THAT HE HAD AT LAST TURNED HIS THOUGHTS TO A PRACTICAL MATTER
HE WELL KNEW THE PERILS OF THE FRONTIER THE SAVAGE STATE OF SOCIETY THE LURKING INDIANS AND THE DANGERS OF FEVER
YES DEAD THESE FOUR YEARS AN A GOOD JOB FOR HER TOO
WELL AS I SAY IT'S AN AWFUL QUEER WORLD THEY CLAP ALL THE BURGLARS INTO JAIL AND THE MURDERERS AND THE WIFE BEATERS I'VE ALLERS THOUGHT A GENTLE REPROOF WOULD BE ENOUGH PUNISHMENT FOR A WIFE BEATER CAUSE HE PROBABLY HAS A LOT O PROVOCATION THAT NOBODY KNOWS AND THE FIREBUGS CAN'T THINK O THE RIGHT NAME SOMETHING LIKE CENDENARIES AN THE BREAKERS O THE PEACE AN WHAT NOT AN YET THE LAW HAS NOTHIN TO SAY TO A MAN LIKE HEN LORD
GRANDFATHER WAS ALEXANDER CAREY L L D DOCTOR OF LAWS THAT IS
MISTER POPHAM LAID DOWN HIS BRUSH
I SWAN TO MAN HE EJACULATED IF YOU DON'T WORK HARD YOU CAN'T KEEP UP WITH THE TIMES DOCTOR OF LAWS
DONE HE AIN'T DONE A THING HE'D OUGHTER SENCE HE WAS BORN
HE KEEPS THE THOU SHALT NOT COMMANDMENTS FIRST RATE HEN LORD DOES
HE GIVE UP HIS POSITION AND SHUT THE FAMILY UP IN THAT TOMB OF A HOUSE SO T HE COULD STUDY HIS BOOKS
MISTER POPHAM EXAGGERATED NOTHING BUT ON THE CONTRARY LEFT MUCH UNSAID IN HIS NARRATIVE OF THE FAMILY AT THE HOUSE OF LORDS
HENRY LORD WITH THE DEGREE OF PH D TO HIS CREDIT HAD BEEN PROFESSOR OF ZOOLOGY AT A NEW ENGLAND COLLEGE BUT HAD RESIGNED HIS POST IN ORDER TO WRITE A SERIES OF SCIENTIFIC TEXT BOOKS
ALWAYS IRRITABLE COLD INDIFFERENT HE HAD GROWN RAPIDLY MORE SO AS YEARS WENT ON
WHATEVER APPEALED TO HER SENSE OF BEAUTY WAS STRAIGHTWAY TRANSFERRED TO PAPER OR CANVAS
SHE IS WILD TO KNOW HOW TO DO THINGS
SHE MAKES EFFORT AFTER EFFORT TREMBLING WITH EAGERNESS AND WHEN SHE FAILS TO REPRODUCE WHAT SHE SEES SHE WORKS HERSELF INTO A FRENZY OF GRIEF AND DISAPPOINTMENT
WHEN SHE COULD NOT MAKE A RABBIT OR A BIRD LOOK REAL ON PAPER SHE SEARCHED IN HER FATHER'S BOOKS FOR PICTURES OF ITS BONES
CYRIL THERE MUST BE SOME BETTER WAY OF DOING I JUST DRAW THE OUTLINE OF AN ANIMAL AND THEN I PUT HAIRS OR FEATHERS ON IT THEY HAVE NO BODIES
THEY COULDN'T RUN NOR MOVE THEY'RE JUST PASTEBOARD
HE WOULDN'T SEARCH SO DON'T WORRY REPLIED CYRIL QUIETLY AND THE TWO LOOKED AT EACH OTHER AND KNEW THAT IT WAS SO
THERE IN THE CEDAR HOLLOW THEN LIVED OLIVE LORD AN ANGRY RESENTFUL LITTLE CREATURE WEIGHED DOWN BY A FIERCE SENSE OF INJURY
OLIVE'S MOURNFUL BLACK EYES MET NANCY'S SPARKLING BROWN ONES
NANCY'S CURLY CHESTNUT CROP SHONE IN THE SUN AND OLIVE'S THICK BLACK PLAITS LOOKED BLACKER BY CONTRAST
SHE'S WONDERFUL MORE WONDERFUL THAN ANYBODY WE'VE EVER SEEN ANYWHERE AND SHE DRAWS BETTER THAN THE TEACHER IN CHARLESTOWN
SHE'S OLDER THAN I AM BUT SO TINY AND SAD AND SHY THAT SHE SEEMS LIKE A CHILD
BUT THE MORE FORGETFULNESS HAD THEN PREVAILED THE MORE POWERFUL WAS THE FORCE OF REMEMBRANCE WHEN SHE AWOKE
MISS MILNER'S HEALTH IS NOT GOOD
SAID MISSUS HORTON A FEW MINUTES AFTER
SO THERE IS TO ME ADDED SANDFORD WITH A SARCASTIC SNEER
AND YET YOU MUST OWN HER BEHAVIOUR HAS WARRANTED THEM HAS IT NOT BEEN IN THIS PARTICULAR INCOHERENT AND UNACCOUNTABLE
NOT THAT I KNOW OF NOT ONE MORE THAT I KNOW OF HE REPLIED WITH ASTONISHMENT AT WHAT SHE HAD INSINUATED AND YET WITH A PERFECT ASSURANCE THAT SHE WAS IN THE WRONG
PERHAPS I AM MISTAKEN ANSWERED SHE
TO ASK ANY MORE QUESTIONS OF YOU I BELIEVE WOULD BE UNFAIR
HE SEEMED TO WAIT FOR HER REPLY BUT AS SHE MADE NONE HE PROCEEDED
OH MY LORD CRIED MISS WOODLEY WITH A MOST FORCIBLE ACCENT YOU ARE THE LAST PERSON ON EARTH SHE WOULD PARDON ME FOR ENTRUSTING
BUT IN SUCH A CASE MISS MILNER'S ELECTION OF A HUSBAND SHALL NOT DIRECT MINE
IF SHE DOES NOT KNOW HOW TO ESTIMATE HER OWN VALUE I DO
INDEPENDENT OF HER FORTUNE SHE HAS BEAUTY TO CAPTIVATE THE HEART OF ANY MAN AND WITH ALL HER FOLLIES SHE HAS A FRANKNESS IN HER MANNER AN UNAFFECTED WISDOM IN HER THOUGHTS A VIVACITY IN HER CONVERSATION AND WITHAL A SOFTNESS IN HER DEMEANOUR THAT MIGHT ALONE ENGAGE THE AFFECTIONS OF A MAN OF THE NICEST SENTIMENTS AND THE STRONGEST UNDERSTANDING
MY LORD MISS MILNER'S TASTE IS NOT A DEPRAVED ONE IT IS BUT TOO REFINED
WHAT CAN YOU MEAN BY THAT MISS WOODLEY YOU TALK MYSTERIOUSLY
IS SHE NOT AFRAID THAT I WILL THWART HER INCLINATIONS
AGAIN HE SEARCHED HIS OWN THOUGHTS NOR INEFFECTUALLY AS BEFORE
MISS WOODLEY WAS TOO LITTLE VERSED IN THE SUBJECT TO KNOW THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN NOT TO LOVE AT ALL AT LEAST NOT TO THE EXTENT OF BREAKING THROUGH ENGAGEMENTS AND ALL THE VARIOUS OBSTACLES THAT STILL MILITATED AGAINST THEIR UNION
TO RELIEVE HER FROM BOTH HE LAID HIS HAND WITH FORCE UPON HIS HEART AND SAID DO YOU BELIEVE ME
I WILL MAKE NO UNJUST USE OF WHAT I KNOW HE REPLIED WITH FIRMNESS I BELIEVE YOU MY LORD
I HAVE NEVER YET HOWEVER BEEN VANQUISHED BY THEM AND EVEN UPON THIS OCCASION MY REASON SHALL COMBAT THEM TO THE LAST AND MY REASON SHALL FAIL ME BEFORE I DO WRONG
NATTY HARMON TRIED THE KITCHEN PUMP SECRETLY SEVERAL TIMES DURING THE EVENING FOR THE WATER HAD TO RUN UP HILL ALL THE WAY FROM THE WELL TO THE KITCHEN SINK AND HE BELIEVED THIS TO BE A CONTINUAL MIRACLE THAT MIGHT GIVE OUT AT ANY MOMENT
TO NIGHT THERE WAS NO NEED OF EXTRA HEAT AND THERE WERE GREAT CEREMONIES TO BE OBSERVED IN LIGHTING THE FIRES ON THE HEARTHSTONES
THEY BEGAN WITH THE ONE IN THE FAMILY SITTING ROOM COLONEL WHEELER RALPH THURSTON MISTER AND MISSUS BILL HARMON WITH NATTY AND RUFUS MISTER AND MISSUS POPHAM WITH DIGBY AND LALLIE JOY ALL STANDING IN ADMIRING GROUPS AND THRILLING WITH DELIGHT AT THE ORDER OF EVENTS
KATHLEEN WAVED THE TORCH TO AND FRO AS SHE RECITED SOME BEAUTIFUL LINES WRITTEN FOR SOME SUCH PURPOSE AS THAT WHICH CALLED THEM TOGETHER TO NIGHT
BURN FIRE BURN FLICKER FLICKER FLAME
NEXT CAME OLIVE'S TURN TO HELP IN THE CEREMONIES
RALPH THURSTON HAD FOUND A LINE OF LATIN FOR THEM IN HIS BELOVED HORACE TIBI SPLENDET FOCUS FOR YOU THE HEARTH FIRE SHINES
OLIVE HAD PAINTED THE MOTTO ON A LONG NARROW PANEL OF CANVAS AND GIVING IT TO MISTER POPHAM STOOD BY THE FIRESIDE WHILE HE DEFTLY FITTED IT INTO THE PLACE PREPARED FOR IT
OLIVE HAS ANOTHER LOVELY GIFT FOR THE YELLOW HOUSE SAID MOTHER CAREY RISING AND TO CARRY OUT THE NEXT PART OF THE PROGRAMME WE SHALL HAVE TO GO IN PROCESSION UPSTAIRS TO MY BEDROOM
EXCLAIMED BILL HARMON TO HIS WIFE AS THEY WENT THROUGH THE LIGHTED HALL
AIN'T THEY THE GREATEST
MOTHER CAREY POURED COFFEE NANCY CHOCOLATE AND THE OTHERS HELPED SERVE THE SANDWICHES AND CAKE DOUGHNUTS AND TARTS
AT THAT MOMENT THE GENTLEMAN ENTERED BEARING A HUGE OBJECT CONCEALED BY A PIECE OF GREEN FELT
APPROACHING THE DINING TABLE HE CAREFULLY PLACED THE ARTICLE IN THE CENTRE AND REMOVED THE CLOTH
THINKS I TO MYSELF I NEVER SEEN ANYTHING OSH POPHAM COULDN'T MEND IF HE TOOK TIME ENOUGH AND GLUE ENOUGH SO I CARRIED THIS LITTLE FELLER HOME IN A BUSHEL BASKET ONE NIGHT LAST MONTH AN I'VE SPENT ELEVEN EVENIN'S PUTTIN HIM TOGETHER
MISSUS HARMON THOUGHT HE SANG TOO MUCH AND TOLD HER HUSBAND PRIVATELY THAT IF HE WAS A CANARY BIRD SHE SHOULD WANT TO KEEP A TABLE COVER OVER HIS HEAD MOST OF THE TIME BUT HE WAS IMMENSELY POPULAR WITH THE REST OF HIS AUDIENCE
THE FACE OF THE MAHOGANY SHONE WITH DELIGHT AND WHY NOT WHEN IT WAS DOING EVERYTHING ALMOST EVERYTHING WITHIN THE SCOPE OF A PIANO AND YET THE FAMILY HAD ENJOYED WEEKS OF GOOD NOURISHING MEALS ON WHAT HAD BEEN SAVED BY ITS EXERTIONS
WE SHUT OUR EYES THE FLOWERS BLOOM ON WE MURMUR BUT THE CORN EARS FILL WE CHOOSE THE SHADOW BUT THE SUN THAT CASTS IT SHINES BEHIND US STILL
HE BEGAN A CONFUSED COMPLAINT AGAINST THE WIZARD WHO HAD VANISHED BEHIND THE CURTAIN ON THE LEFT
GIVE NOT SO EARNEST A MIND TO THESE MUMMERIES CHILD
A GOLDEN FORTUNE AND A HAPPY LIFE
HE WAS LIKE UNTO MY FATHER IN A WAY AND YET WAS NOT MY FATHER
ALSO THERE WAS A STRIPLING PAGE WHO TURNED INTO A MAID
THIS WAS SO SWEET A LADY SIR AND IN SOME MANNER I DO THINK SHE DIED
BUT THEN THE PICTURE WAS GONE AS QUICKLY AS IT CAME
SISTER NELL DO YOU HEAR THESE MARVELS
TAKE YOUR PLACE AND LET US SEE WHAT THE CRYSTAL CAN SHOW TO YOU
LIKE AS NOT YOUNG MASTER THOUGH I AM AN OLD MAN
FORTHWITH ALL RAN TO THE OPENING OF THE TENT TO SEE WHAT MIGHT BE AMISS BUT MASTER WILL WHO PEEPED OUT FIRST NEEDED NO MORE THAN ONE GLANCE
HE GAVE WAY TO THE OTHERS VERY READILY AND RETREATED UNPERCEIVED BY THE SQUIRE AND MISTRESS FITZOOTH TO THE REAR OF THE TENT
CRIES OF A NOTTINGHAM A NOTTINGHAM
BEFORE THEM FLED THE STROLLER AND HIS THREE SONS CAPLESS AND TERRIFIED
WHAT IS THE TUMULT AND RIOTING CRIED OUT THE SQUIRE AUTHORITATIVELY AND HE BLEW TWICE ON A SILVER WHISTLE WHICH HUNG AT HIS BELT
NAY WE REFUSED THEIR REQUEST MOST POLITELY MOST NOBLE SAID THE LITTLE STROLLER
AND THEN THEY BECAME VEXED AND WOULD HAVE SNATCHED YOUR PURSE FROM US
I COULD NOT SEE MY BOY INJURED EXCELLENCE FOR BUT DOING HIS DUTY AS ONE OF CUMBERLAND'S SONS
SO I DID PUSH THIS FELLOW
IT IS ENOUGH SAID GEORGE GAMEWELL SHARPLY AND HE TURNED UPON THE CROWD
SHAME ON YOU CITIZENS CRIED HE I BLUSH FOR MY FELLOWS OF NOTTINGHAM
SURELY WE CAN SUBMIT WITH GOOD GRACE
TIS FINE FOR YOU TO TALK OLD MAN ANSWERED THE LEAN SULLEN APPRENTICE
BUT I WRESTLED WITH THIS FELLOW AND DO KNOW THAT HE PLAYED UNFAIRLY IN THE SECOND BOUT
SPOKE THE SQUIRE LOSING ALL PATIENCE AND IT WAS TO YOU THAT I GAVE ANOTHER PURSE IN CONSOLATION
COME TO ME MEN HERE HERE HE RAISED HIS VOICE STILL LOUDER
THE STROLLERS TOOK THEIR PART IN IT WITH HEARTY ZEST NOW THAT THEY HAD SOME CHANCE OF BEATING OFF THEIR FOES
ROBIN AND THE LITTLE TUMBLER BETWEEN THEM TRIED TO FORCE THE SQUIRE TO STAND BACK AND VERY VALIANTLY DID THESE TWO COMPORT THEMSELVES
THE HEAD AND CHIEF OF THE RIOT THE NOTTINGHAM APPRENTICE WITH CLENCHED FISTS THREATENED MONTFICHET
THE SQUIRE HELPED TO THRUST THEM ALL IN AND ENTERED SWIFTLY HIMSELF
NOW BE SILENT ON YOUR LIVES HE BEGAN BUT THE CAPTURED APPRENTICE SET UP AN INSTANT SHOUT
SILENCE YOU KNAVE CRIED MONTFICHET
HE FELT FOR AND FOUND THE WIZARD'S BLACK CLOTH THE SQUIRE WAS QUITE OUT OF BREATH
THRUSTING OPEN THE PROPER ENTRANCE OF THE TENT ROBIN SUDDENLY RUSHED FORTH WITH HIS BURDEN WITH A GREAT SHOUT
A MONTFICHET A MONTFICHET GAMEWELL TO THE RESCUE
TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THIS THE SQUIRE'S FEW MEN REDOUBLED THEIR EFFORTS AND ENCOURAGED BY ROBIN'S AND THE LITTLE STROLLER'S CRIES FOUGHT THEIR WAY TO HIM
GEORGE MONTFICHET WILL NEVER FORGET THIS DAY
WHAT IS YOUR NAME LORDING ASKED THE LITTLE STROLLER PRESENTLY

AND MINE IS WILL STUTELEY SHALL WE BE COMRADES
RIGHT WILLINGLY FOR BETWEEN US WE HAVE WON THE BATTLE ANSWERED ROBIN
I LIKE YOU WILL YOU ARE THE SECOND WILL THAT I HAVE MET AND LIKED WITHIN TWO DAYS IS THERE A SIGN IN THAT
MONTFICHET CALLED OUT FOR ROBIN TO GIVE HIM AN ARM
FRIENDS SAID MONTFICHET FAINTLY TO THE WRESTLERS BEAR US ESCORT SO FAR AS THE SHERIFF'S HOUSE
IT WILL NOT BE SAFE FOR YOU TO STAY HERE NOW
PRAY FOLLOW US WITH MINE AND MY LORD SHERIFF'S MEN
NOTTINGHAM CASTLE WAS REACHED AND ADMITTANCE WAS DEMANDED
MASTER MONCEUX THE SHERIFF OF NOTTINGHAM WAS MIGHTILY PUT ABOUT WHEN TOLD OF THE RIOTING
AND HENRY MIGHT RETURN TO ENGLAND AT ANY MOMENT
HAVE YOUR WILL CHILD IF THE BOY ALSO WILLS IT MONTFICHET ANSWERED FEELING TOO ILL TO OPPOSE ANYTHING VERY STRONGLY JUST THEN
HE MADE AN EFFORT TO HIDE HIS CONDITION FROM THEM ALL AND ROBIN FELT HIS FINGERS TIGHTEN UPON HIS ARM
BEG ME A ROOM OF THE SHERIFF CHILD QUICKLY
BUT WHO IS THIS FELLOW PLUCKING AT YOUR SLEEVE
HE IS MY ESQUIRE EXCELLENCY RETURNED ROBIN WITH DIGNITY
MISTRESS FITZOOTH HAD BEEN CARRIED OFF BY THE SHERIFF'S DAUGHTER AND HER MAIDS AS SOON AS THEY HAD ENTERED THE HOUSE SO THAT ROBIN ALONE HAD THE CARE OF MONTFICHET
ROBIN WAS GLAD WHEN AT LENGTH THEY WERE LEFT TO THEIR OWN DEVICES
THE WINE DID CERTAINLY BRING BACK THE COLOR TO THE SQUIRE'S CHEEKS
THESE ESCAPADES ARE NOT FOR OLD GAMEWELL LAD HIS DAY HAS COME TO TWILIGHT
WILL YOU FORGIVE ME NOW
IT WILL BE NO DISAPPOINTMENT TO ME
NO THANKS I AM GLAD TO GIVE YOU SUCH EASY HAPPINESS
YOU ARE A WORTHY LEECH WILL PRESENTLY WHISPERED ROBIN THE WINE HAS WORKED A MARVEL
AY AND SHOW YOU SOME PRETTY TRICKS
YOUNG FITZOOTH HAD BEEN COMMANDED TO HIS MOTHER'S CHAMBER SO SOON AS HE HAD COME OUT FROM HIS CONVERSE WITH THE SQUIRE
THERE BEFELL AN ANXIOUS INTERVIEW MISTRESS FITZOOTH ARGUING FOR AND AGAINST THE SQUIRE'S PROJECT IN A BREATH
MOST OF ALL ROBIN THOUGHT OF HIS FATHER WHAT WOULD HE COUNSEL
IF FOR A WHIM YOU BEGGAR YOURSELF I CANNOT STAY YOU
BUT TAKE IT WHILST I LIVE AND WEAR MONTFICHET'S SHIELD IN THE DAYS WHEN MY EYES CAN BE REJOICED BY SO BRAVE A SIGHT FOR YOU WILL NE'ER DISGRACE OUR SCUTCHEON I WARRANT ME
THE LAD HAD CHECKED HIM THEN
NEVER THAT SIR HE HAD SAID
HE WAS IN DEEP CONVERSE WITH THE CLERK AND ENTERED THE HALL HOLDING HIM BY THE ARM
NOW TO BED BOY
TIS LATE AND I GO MYSELF WITHIN A SHORT SPACE
DISMISS YOUR SQUIRE ROBIN AND BID ME GOOD E E N
AS ANY IN ENGLAND I WOULD SAY SAID GAMEWELL PROUDLY THAT IS IN HIS DAY
YET HE WILL TEACH YOU A FEW TRICKS WHEN MORNING IS COME
THERE WAS NO CHANCE TO ALTER HIS SLEEPING ROOM TO ONE NEARER TO GAMEWELL'S CHAMBER
PRESENTLY HE CROSSED THE FLOOR OF HIS ROOM WITH DECIDED STEP
WILL CRIED HE SOFTLY AND STUTELEY WHO HAD CHOSEN HIS COUCH ACROSS THE DOOR OF HIS YOUNG MASTER'S CHAMBER SPRANG UP AT ONCE IN ANSWER
WE WILL GO OUT TOGETHER TO THE BOWER THERE IS A WAY DOWN TO THE COURT FROM MY WINDOW
REST AND BE STILL UNTIL I WARN YOU
THE HOURS PASSED WEARILY BY AND MOVEMENT COULD YET BE HEARD ABOUT THE HALL
AT LAST ALL WAS QUIET AND BLACK IN THE COURTYARD OF GAMEWELL
WILL WHISPERED ROBIN OPENING HIS DOOR AS HE SPOKE ARE YOU READY
THEY THEN RENEWED THEIR JOURNEY AND UNDER THE BETTER LIGHT MADE A SAFE CROSSING OF THE STABLE ROOFS
ROBIN ENTERED THE HUT DRAGGING THE UNWILLING ESQUIRE AFTER HIM
BE NOT SO FOOLISH FRIEND SAID FITZOOTH CROSSLY
THEY MOVED THEREAFTER CAUTIOUSLY ABOUT THE HUT GROPING BEFORE AND ABOUT THEM TO FIND SOMETHING TO SHOW THAT WARRENTON HAD FULFILLED HIS MISSION
THEY WERE UPON THE VERGE OF AN OPEN TRAP IN THE FAR CORNER OF THE HUT AND STUTELEY HAD TRIPPED OVER THE EDGE OF THE REVERSED FLAP MOUTH OF THIS PIT
FITZOOTH'S HAND RESTED AT LAST UPON THE TOP RUNG OF A LADDER AND SLOWLY THE TRUTH CAME TO HIM
ROBIN CAREFULLY DESCENDED THE LADDER AND FOUND HIMSELF SOON UPON FIRM ROCKY GROUND
STUTELEY WAS BY HIS SIDE IN A FLASH AND THEN THEY BOTH BEGAN FEELING ABOUT THEM TO ASCERTAIN THE SHAPE AND CHARACTER OF THIS VAULT
FROM THE BLACKNESS BEHIND THE LIGHT THEY HEARD A VOICE WARRENTON'S
SAVE ME MASTERS BUT YOU STARTLED ME RARELY
CRIED HE WAVING THE LANTHORN BEFORE HIM TO MAKE SURE THAT THESE WERE NO GHOSTS IN FRONT OF HIM
ENQUIRED ROBIN WITH HIS SUSPICIONS STILL UPON HIM
TRULY SUCH A HORSE SHOULD BE WORTH MUCH IN NOTTINGHAM FAIR
NAY NAY LORDING ANSWERED WARRENTON WITH A HALF LAUGH
WARRENTON SPOKE THUS WITH SIGNIFICANCE TO SHOW ROBIN THAT HE WAS NOT TO THINK GEOFFREY'S CLAIMS TO THE ESTATE WOULD BE PASSED BY
ROBIN FITZOOTH SAW THAT HIS DOUBTS OF WARRENTON HAD BEEN UNFAIR AND HE BECAME ASHAMED OF HIMSELF FOR HARBORING THEM
HIS TONES RANG PLEASANTLY ON WARRENTON'S EARS AND FORTHWITH A GOOD FELLOWSHIP WAS HERALDED BETWEEN THEM
THE OLD SERVANT TOLD HIM QUIETLY AS THEY CREPT BACK TO GAMEWELL THAT THIS PASSAGE WAY LED FROM THE HUT IN THE PLEASANCE TO SHERWOOD AND THAT GEOFFREY FOR THE TIME WAS HIDING WITH THE OUTLAWS IN THE FOREST
HE IMPLORES US TO BE DISCREET AS THE GRAVE IN THIS MATTER FOR IN SOOTH HIS LIFE IS IN THE HOLLOW OF OUR HANDS
THEY REGAINED THEIR APARTMENT APPARENTLY WITHOUT DISTURBING THE HOUSEHOLD OF GAMEWELL
BRIGHTER THAN EARLY DAWN'S MOST BRILLIANT DYE ARE BLOWN CLEAR BANDS OF COLOR THROUGH THE SKY THAT SWIRL AND SWEEP AND MEET TO BREAK AND FOAM LIKE RAINBOW VEILS UPON A BUBBLE'S DOME
GUIDED BY YOU HOW WE MIGHT STROLL TOWARDS DEATH OUR ONLY MUSIC ONE ANOTHER'S BREATH THROUGH GARDENS INTIMATE WITH HOLLYHOCKS WHERE SILENT POPPIES BURN BETWEEN THE ROCKS BY POOLS WHERE BIRCHES BEND TO CONFIDANTS ABOVE GREEN WATERS SCUMMED WITH LILY PLANTS
VENICE
IN A SUNSET GLOWING OF CRIMSON AND GOLD SHE LIES THE GLORY OF THE WORLD A BEACHED KING'S GALLEY WHOSE SAILS ARE FURLED WHO IS HUNG WITH TAPESTRIES RICH AND OLD
THE PITY THAT WE MUST COME AND GO
WHILE THE OLD GOLD AND THE MARBLE STAYS FOREVER GLEAMING ITS SOFT STRONG BLAZE CALM IN THE EARLY EVENING GLOW
THE PLEASANT GRAVEYARD OF MY SOUL WITH SENTIMENTAL CYPRESS TREES AND FLOWERS IS FILLED THAT I MAY STROLL IN MEDITATION AT MY EASE
IT IS MY HEART HUNG IN THE SKY AND NO CLOUDS EVER FLOAT BETWEEN THE GRAVE FLOWERS AND MY HEART ON HIGH
OVER THE TRACK LINED CITY STREET THE YOUNG MEN THE GRINNING MEN PASS
HO YE SAILS THAT SEEM TO WANDER IN DREAM FILLED MEADOWS SAY IS THE SHORE WHERE I STAND THE ONLY FIELD OF STRUGGLE OR ARE YE HIT AND BATTERED OUT THERE BY WAVES AND WIND GUSTS AS YE TACK OVER A CLASHING SEA OF WATERY ECHOES
OLD DANCES ARE SIMPLIFIED OF THEIR YEARNING BLEACHED BY TIME
HE HAD GOT INTO HER COURTYARD
THROUGH THE BLACK NIGHT RAIN HE SANG TO HER WINDOW BARS
THAT WAS BUT RUSTLING OF DRIPPING PLANTS IN THE DARK
SHE WAS ALONE THAT NIGHT
HE HAD BROKEN INTO HER COURTYARD
THEN HE RUSHED DOWN STAIRS INTO THE COURTYARD SHOUTING LOUDLY FOR HIS SOLDIERS AND THREATENING TO PATCH EVERYBODY IN HIS DOMINIONS IF THE SAILORMAN WAS NOT RECAPTURED
HOLD HIM FAST MY MEN AND AS SOON AS I'VE HAD MY COFFEE AND OATMEAL I'LL TAKE HIM TO THE ROOM OF THE GREAT KNIFE AND PATCH HIM
I WOULDN'T MIND A CUP O COFFEE MYSELF SAID CAP'N BILL I'VE HAD CONSID'BLE EXERCISE THIS MORNIN AND I'M ALL READY FOR BREAKFAS
BUT CAP'N BILL MADE NO SUCH ATTEMPT KNOWING IT WOULD BE USELESS
AS SOON AS THEY ENTERED THE ROOM OF THE GREAT KNIFE THE BOOLOOROO GAVE A YELL OF DISAPPOINTMENT
THE ROOM OF THE GREAT KNIFE WAS HIGH AND BIG AND AROUND IT RAN ROWS OF BENCHES FOR THE SPECTATORS TO SIT UPON
IN ONE PLACE AT THE HEAD OF THE ROOM WAS A RAISED PLATFORM FOR THE ROYAL FAMILY WITH ELEGANT THRONE CHAIRS FOR THE KING AND QUEEN AND SIX SMALLER BUT RICHLY UPHOLSTERED CHAIRS FOR THE SNUBNOSED PRINCESSES
THEREFORE HER MAJESTY PAID NO ATTENTION TO ANYONE AND NO ONE PAID ANY ATTENTION TO HER
RICH JEWELS OF BLUE STONES GLITTERED UPON THEIR PERSONS AND THE ROYAL LADIES WERE FULLY AS GORGEOUS AS THEY WERE HAUGHTY AND OVERBEARING
MORNIN GIRLS HOPE YE FEEL AS WELL AS YE LOOK
CONTROL YOURSELVES MY DEARS REPLIED THE BOOLOOROO THE WORST PUNISHMENT I KNOW HOW TO INFLICT ON ANYONE THIS PRISONER IS ABOUT TO SUFFER YOU'LL SEE A VERY PRETTY PATCHING MY ROYAL DAUGHTERS
SUPPOSE IT'S A FRIEND
THE CAPTAIN SHOOK HIS HEAD
WHY YOU SAID TO FETCH THE FIRST LIVING CREATURE WE MET AND THAT WAS THIS BILLYGOAT REPLIED THE CAPTAIN PANTING HARD AS HE HELD FAST TO ONE OF THE GOAT'S HORNS
THE IDEA OF PATCHING CAP'N BILL TO A GOAT WAS VASTLY AMUSING TO HIM AND THE MORE HE THOUGHT OF IT THE MORE HE ROARED WITH LAUGHTER
THEY LOOK SOMETHING ALIKE YOU KNOW SUGGESTED THE CAPTAIN OF THE GUARDS LOOKING FROM ONE TO THE OTHER DOUBTFULLY AND THEY'RE NEARLY THE SAME SIZE IF YOU STAND THE GOAT ON HIS HIND LEGS THEY'VE BOTH GOT THE SAME STYLE OF WHISKERS AND THEY'RE BOTH OF EM OBSTINATE AND DANGEROUS SO THEY OUGHT TO MAKE A GOOD PATCH SPLENDID
FINE GLORIOUS
WHEN THIS HAD BEEN ACCOMPLISHED THE BOOLOOROO LEANED OVER TO TRY TO DISCOVER WHY THE FRAME ROLLED AWAY SEEMINGLY OF ITS OWN ACCORD AND HE WAS THE MORE PUZZLED BECAUSE IT HAD NEVER DONE SUCH A THING BEFORE
AT ONCE THE GOAT GAVE A LEAP ESCAPED FROM THE SOLDIERS AND WITH BOWED HEAD RUSHED UPON THE BOOLOOROO
BEFORE ANY COULD STOP HIM HE BUTTED HIS MAJESTY SO FURIOUSLY THAT THE KING SOARED FAR INTO THE AIR AND TUMBLED IN A HEAP AMONG THE BENCHES WHERE HE LAY MOANING AND GROANING
THE GOAT'S WARLIKE SPIRIT WAS ROUSED BY THIS SUCCESSFUL ATTACK
THEN THEY SPED IN GREAT HASTE FOR THE DOOR AND THE GOAT GAVE A FINAL BUTT THAT SENT THE ROW OF ROYAL LADIES ALL DIVING INTO THE CORRIDOR IN ANOTHER TANGLE WHEREUPON THEY SHRIEKED IN A MANNER THAT TERRIFIED EVERYONE WITHIN SOUND OF THEIR VOICES
I HAD A NOTION IT WAS YOU MATE AS SAVED ME FROM THE KNIFE
I COULDN'T SHIVER MUCH BEIN BOUND SO TIGHT BUT WHEN I'M LOOSE I MEAN TO HAVE JUS ONE GOOD SHIVER TO RELIEVE MY FEELIN'S
COME AND GET THE BOOLOOROO SHE SAID GOING TOWARD THE BENCHES
SO THEY WERE QUITE WILLING TO OBEY THE ORDERS OF THEIR GIRL QUEEN AND IN A SHORT TIME THE BLASTS OF TRUMPETS AND ROLL OF DRUMS AND CLASHING OF CYMBALS TOLD TROT AND CAP'N BILL THAT THE BLUE BANDS HAD ASSEMBLED BEFORE THE PALACE
THEN THEY ALL MARCHED OUT A LITTLE WAY INTO THE FIELDS AND FOUND THAT THE ARMY OF PINKIES HAD ALREADY FORMED AND WAS ADVANCING STEADILY TOWARD THEM
AT THE HEAD OF THE PINKIES WERE GHIP GHISIZZLE AND BUTTON BRIGHT WHO HAD THE PARROT ON HIS SHOULDER AND THEY WERE SUPPORTED BY CAPTAIN CORALIE AND CAPTAIN TINTINT AND ROSALIE THE WITCH
WHEN THE BLUESKINS SAW GHIP GHISIZZLE THEY RAISED ANOTHER GREAT SHOUT FOR HE WAS THE FAVORITE OF THE SOLDIERS AND VERY POPULAR WITH ALL THE PEOPLE
SINCE LAST THURSDAY I GHIP GHISIZZLE HAVE BEEN THE LAWFUL BOOLOOROO OF THE BLUE COUNTRY BUT NOW THAT YOU ARE CONQUERED BY QUEEN TROT I SUPPOSE I AM CONQUERED TOO AND YOU HAVE NO BOOLOOROO AT ALL
WHEN HE FINISHED SHE SAID CHEERFULLY
DON'T WORRY SIZZLE DEAR IT'LL ALL COME RIGHT PRETTY SOON
NOW THEN LET'S ENTER THE CITY AN ENJOY THE GRAND FEAST THAT'S BEING COOKED I'M NEARLY STARVED MYSELF FOR THIS CONQUERIN KINGDOMS IS HARD WORK
THEN SHE GAVE ROSALIE BACK HER MAGIC RING THANKING THE KIND WITCH FOR ALL SHE HAD DONE FOR THEM
YOU ARE MATE REPLIED THE SAILOR
IT WILL BE SUCH A SATISFACTION
THE GUARDS HAD A TERRIBLE STRUGGLE WITH THE GOAT WHICH WAS LOOSE IN THE ROOM AND STILL WANTED TO FIGHT BUT FINALLY THEY SUBDUED THE ANIMAL AND THEN THEY TOOK THE BOOLOOROO OUT OF THE FRAME HE WAS TIED IN AND BROUGHT BOTH HIM AND THE GOAT BEFORE QUEEN TROT WHO AWAITED THEM IN THE THRONE ROOM OF THE PALACE
I'LL GLADLY DO THAT PROMISED THE NEW BOOLOOROO AND I'LL FEED THE HONORABLE GOAT ALL THE SHAVINGS AND LEATHER AND TIN CANS HE CAN EAT BESIDES THE GRASS
SCUSE ME SAID TROT I NEGLECTED TO TELL YOU THAT YOU'RE NOT THE BOOLOOROO ANY MORE
THE FORMER BOOLOOROO GROANED
I'LL NOT BE WICKED ANY MORE SIGHED THE OLD BOOLOOROO I'LL REFORM
AS A PRIVATE CITIZEN I SHALL BE A MODEL OF DEPORTMENT BECAUSE IT WOULD BE DANGEROUS TO BE OTHERWISE
WHEN FIRST THEY ENTERED THE THRONE ROOM THEY TRIED TO BE AS HAUGHTY AND SCORNFUL AS EVER BUT THE BLUES WHO WERE ASSEMBLED THERE ALL LAUGHED AT THEM AND JEERED THEM FOR THERE WAS NOT A SINGLE PERSON IN ALL THE BLUE COUNTRY WHO LOVED THE PRINCESSES THE LEAST LITTLE BIT
SO GHIP GHISIZZLE ORDERED THE CAPTAIN TO TAKE A FILE OF SOLDIERS AND ESCORT THE RAVING BEAUTIES TO THEIR NEW HOME
THAT EVENING TROT GAVE A GRAND BALL IN THE PALACE TO WHICH THE MOST IMPORTANT OF THE PINKIES AND THE BLUESKINS WERE INVITED
THE COMBINED BANDS OF BOTH THE COUNTRIES PLAYED THE MUSIC AND A FINE SUPPER WAS SERVED
FRANK READ ENGLISH SLOWLY AND THE MORE HE READ ABOUT THIS DIVORCE CASE THE ANGRIER HE GREW
MARIE SIGHED
A BRISK WIND HAD COME UP AND WAS DRIVING PUFFY WHITE CLOUDS ACROSS THE SKY
THE ORCHARD WAS SPARKLING AND RIPPLING IN THE SUN
THAT INVITATION DECIDED HER
OH BUT I'M GLAD TO GET THIS PLACE MOWED
JUST SMELL THE WILD ROSES THEY ARE ALWAYS SO SPICY AFTER A RAIN
WE NEVER HAD SO MANY OF THEM IN HERE BEFORE
I SUPPOSE IT'S THE WET SEASON WILL YOU HAVE TO CUT THEM TOO
I SUPPOSE THAT'S THE WET SEASON TOO THEN
IT'S EXCITING TO SEE EVERYTHING GROWING SO FAST AND TO GET THE GRASS CUT
AREN'T YOU SPLASHED LOOK AT THE SPIDER WEBS ALL OVER THE GRASS
IN A FEW MOMENTS HE HEARD THE CHERRIES DROPPING SMARTLY INTO THE PAIL AND HE BEGAN TO SWING HIS SCYTHE WITH THAT LONG EVEN STROKE THAT FEW AMERICAN BOYS EVER LEARN
MARIE PICKED CHERRIES AND SANG SOFTLY TO HERSELF STRIPPING ONE GLITTERING BRANCH AFTER ANOTHER SHIVERING WHEN SHE CAUGHT A SHOWER OF RAINDROPS ON HER NECK AND HAIR
AND EMIL MOWED HIS WAY SLOWLY DOWN TOWARD THE CHERRY TREES
THAT SUMMER THE RAINS HAD BEEN SO MANY AND OPPORTUNE THAT IT WAS ALMOST MORE THAN SHABATA AND HIS MAN COULD DO TO KEEP UP WITH THE CORN THE ORCHARD WAS A NEGLECTED WILDERNESS
I DON'T KNOW ALL OF THEM BUT I KNOW LINDENS ARE
IF I FEEL THAT WAY I FEEL THAT WAY
HE REACHED UP AMONG THE BRANCHES AND BEGAN TO PICK THE SWEET INSIPID FRUIT LONG IVORY COLORED BERRIES TIPPED WITH FAINT PINK LIKE WHITE CORAL THAT FALL TO THE GROUND UNHEEDED ALL SUMMER THROUGH
HE DROPPED A HANDFUL INTO HER LAP
YES DON'T YOU
OH EVER SO MUCH ONLY HE SEEMS KIND OF STAID AND SCHOOL TEACHERY
WHEN SHE USED TO TELL ME ABOUT HIM I ALWAYS WONDERED WHETHER SHE WASN'T A LITTLE IN LOVE WITH HIM
IT WOULD SERVE YOU ALL RIGHT IF SHE WALKED OFF WITH CARL
I LIKE TO TALK TO CARL ABOUT NEW YORK AND WHAT A FELLOW CAN DO THERE
OH EMIL
SURELY YOU ARE NOT THINKING OF GOING OFF THERE
MARIE'S FACE FELL UNDER HIS BROODING GAZE
I'M SURE ALEXANDRA HOPES YOU WILL STAY ON HERE SHE MURMURED
I DON'T WANT TO STAND AROUND AND LOOK ON
I WANT TO BE DOING SOMETHING ON MY OWN ACCOUNT
SOMETIMES I DON'T WANT TO DO ANYTHING AT ALL AND SOMETIMES I WANT TO PULL THE FOUR CORNERS OF THE DIVIDE TOGETHER HE THREW OUT HIS ARM AND BROUGHT IT BACK WITH A JERK SO LIKE A TABLE CLOTH
I GET TIRED OF SEEING MEN AND HORSES GOING UP AND DOWN UP AND DOWN
I WISH YOU WEREN'T SO RESTLESS AND DIDN'T GET SO WORKED UP OVER THINGS SHE SAID SADLY
THANK YOU HE RETURNED SHORTLY
AND YOU NEVER USED TO BE CROSS TO ME
I CAN'T PLAY WITH YOU LIKE A LITTLE BOY ANY MORE HE SAID SLOWLY THAT'S WHAT YOU MISS MARIE
BUT EMIL IF I UNDERSTAND THEN ALL OUR GOOD TIMES ARE OVER WE CAN NEVER DO NICE THINGS TOGETHER ANY MORE
AND ANYHOW THERE'S NOTHING TO UNDERSTAND
THAT WON'T LAST IT WILL GO AWAY AND THINGS WILL BE JUST AS THEY USED TO
I PRAY FOR YOU BUT THAT'S NOT THE SAME AS IF YOU PRAYED YOURSELF
I CAN'T PRAY TO HAVE THE THINGS I WANT HE SAID SLOWLY AND I WON'T PRAY NOT TO HAVE THEM NOT IF I'M DAMNED FOR IT
THEN ALL OUR GOOD TIMES ARE OVER
IT IS SIXTEEN YEARS SINCE JOHN BERGSON DIED
HIS WIFE NOW LIES BESIDE HIM AND THE WHITE SHAFT THAT MARKS THEIR GRAVES GLEAMS ACROSS THE WHEAT FIELDS
FROM THE NORWEGIAN GRAVEYARD ONE LOOKS OUT OVER A VAST CHECKER BOARD MARKED OFF IN SQUARES OF WHEAT AND CORN LIGHT AND DARK DARK AND LIGHT
FROM THE GRAVEYARD GATE ONE CAN COUNT A DOZEN GAYLY PAINTED FARMHOUSES THE GILDED WEATHER VANES ON THE BIG RED BARNS WINK AT EACH OTHER ACROSS THE GREEN AND BROWN AND YELLOW FIELDS
THE AIR AND THE EARTH ARE CURIOUSLY MATED AND INTERMINGLED AS IF THE ONE WERE THE BREATH OF THE OTHER
HE WAS A SPLENDID FIGURE OF A BOY TALL AND STRAIGHT AS A YOUNG PINE TREE WITH A HANDSOME HEAD AND STORMY GRAY EYES DEEPLY SET UNDER A SERIOUS BROW
THAT'S NOT MUCH OF A JOB FOR AN ATHLETE HERE I'VE BEEN TO TOWN AND BACK
ALEXANDRA LETS YOU SLEEP LATE
SHE GATHERED UP HER REINS
PLEASE WAIT FOR ME MARIE EMIL COAXED
I NEVER SEE LOU'S SCYTHE OVER HERE
HOW BROWN YOU'VE GOT SINCE YOU CAME HOME I WISH I HAD AN ATHLETE TO MOW MY ORCHARD
I GET WET TO MY KNEES WHEN I GO DOWN TO PICK CHERRIES
INDEED HE HAD LOOKED AWAY WITH THE PURPOSE OF NOT SEEING IT
THEY THINK YOU'RE PROUD BECAUSE YOU'VE BEEN AWAY TO SCHOOL OR SOMETHING
THERE WAS SOMETHING INDIVIDUAL ABOUT THE GREAT FARM A MOST UNUSUAL TRIMNESS AND CARE FOR DETAIL
ON EITHER SIDE OF THE ROAD FOR A MILE BEFORE YOU REACHED THE FOOT OF THE HILL STOOD TALL OSAGE ORANGE HEDGES THEIR GLOSSY GREEN MARKING OFF THE YELLOW FIELDS
ANY ONE THEREABOUTS WOULD HAVE TOLD YOU THAT THIS WAS ONE OF THE RICHEST FARMS ON THE DIVIDE AND THAT THE FARMER WAS A WOMAN ALEXANDRA BERGSON
THERE IS EVEN A WHITE ROW OF BEEHIVES IN THE ORCHARD UNDER THE WALNUT TREES
HERE SHE WOULD STAY COMFORTED AND SOOTHED AMONG THE LOVELY PLANTS AND RICH EXOTICS REJOICING THE HEART OF OLD TURNER THE GARDENER WHO SINCE POLLY'S FIRST RAPTUROUS ENTRANCE HAD TAKEN HER INTO HIS GOOD GRACES FOR ALL TIME
EVERY CHANCE SHE COULD STEAL AFTER PRACTICE HOURS WERE OVER AND AFTER THE CLAMOROUS DEMANDS OF THE BOYS UPON HER TIME WERE FULLY SATISFIED WAS SEIZED TO FLY ON THE WINGS OF THE WIND TO THE FLOWERS
THEN DEAR SAID MISSUS WHITNEY YOU MUST BE KINDER TO HER THAN EVER THINK WHAT IT WOULD BE FOR ONE OF YOU TO BE AWAY FROM HOME EVEN AMONG FRIENDS
SOMEHOW OF ALL THE DAYS WHEN THE HOME FEELING WAS THE STRONGEST THIS DAY IT SEEMED AS IF SHE COULD BEAR IT NO LONGER
IF SHE COULD ONLY SEE PHRONSIE FOR JUST ONE MOMENT
OH SHE'S ALWAYS AT THE PIANO SAID VAN SHE MUST BE THERE NOW SOMEWHERE AND THEN SOMEBODY LAUGHED
AT THIS THE BUNDLE OPENED SUDDENLY AND OUT POPPED PHRONSIE
BUT POLLY COULDN'T SPEAK AND IF JASPER HADN'T CAUGHT HER JUST IN TIME SHE WOULD HAVE TUMBLED OVER BACKWARD FROM THE STOOL PHRONSIE AND ALL
ASKED PHRONSIE WITH HER LITTLE FACE CLOSE TO POLLY'S OWN
NOW YOU'LL STAY CRIED VAN SAY POLLY WON'T YOU
OH YOU ARE THE DEAREST AND BEST MISTER KING I EVER SAW BUT HOW DID YOU MAKE MAMMY LET HER COME
ISN'T HE SPLENDID CRIED JASPER IN INTENSE PRIDE SWELLING UP FATHER KNEW HOW TO DO IT
THERE THERE HE SAID SOOTHINGLY PATTING HER BROWN FUZZY HEAD
I KNOW GASPED POLLY CONTROLLING HER SOBS I WON'T ONLY I CAN'T THANK YOU
ASKED PHRONSIE IN INTENSE INTEREST SLIPPING DOWN OUT OF POLLY'S ARMS AND CROWDING UP CLOSE TO JASPER'S SIDE
YES ALL ALONE BY HIMSELF ASSERTED JASPER VEHEMENTLY AND WINKING FURIOUSLY TO THE OTHERS TO STOP THEIR LAUGHING HE DID NOW TRULY PHRONSIE
OH NO JASPER I MUST GO BY MY VERY OWN SELF
THERE JAP YOU'VE CAUGHT IT LAUGHED PERCY WHILE THE OTHERS SCREAMED AT THE SIGHT OF JASPER'S FACE
DON'T MIND IT POLLY WHISPERED JASPER TWASN'T HER FAULT
DEAR ME EJACULATED THE OLD GENTLEMAN IN THE UTMOST AMAZEMENT AND SUCH A TIME AS I'VE HAD TO GET HER HERE TOO
HOW DID HER MOTHER EVER LET HER GO
SHE ASKED IMPULSIVELY I DIDN'T BELIEVE YOU COULD PERSUADE HER FATHER
I DIDN'T HAVE ANY FEARS IF I WORKED IT RIGHTLY SAID THE OLD GENTLEMAN COMPLACENTLY
HE CRIED IN HIGH DUDGEON JUST AS IF HE OWNED THE WHOLE OF THE PEPPERS AND COULD DISPOSE OF THEM ALL TO SUIT HIS FANCY
AND THE OLD GENTLEMAN WAS SO DELIGHTED WITH HIS SUCCESS THAT HE HAD TO BURST OUT INTO A SERIES OF SHORT HAPPY BITS OF LAUGHTER THAT OCCUPIED QUITE A SPACE OF TIME
AT LAST HE CAME OUT OF THEM AND WIPED HIS FACE VIGOROUSLY
BUT ALREADY AT A POINT IN ECONOMIC EVOLUTION FAR ANTEDATING THE EMERGENCE OF THE LADY SPECIALISED CONSUMPTION OF GOODS AS AN EVIDENCE OF PECUNIARY STRENGTH HAD BEGUN TO WORK OUT IN A MORE OR LESS ELABORATE SYSTEM
THE UTILITY OF CONSUMPTION AS AN EVIDENCE OF WEALTH IS TO BE CLASSED AS A DERIVATIVE GROWTH
SUCH CONSUMPTION AS FALLS TO THE WOMEN IS MERELY INCIDENTAL TO THEIR WORK IT IS A MEANS TO THEIR CONTINUED LABOUR AND NOT A CONSUMPTION DIRECTED TO THEIR OWN COMFORT AND FULNESS OF LIFE
WITH A FURTHER ADVANCE IN CULTURE THIS TABU MAY CHANGE INTO SIMPLE CUSTOM OF A MORE OR LESS RIGOROUS CHARACTER BUT WHATEVER BE THE THEORETICAL BASIS OF THE DISTINCTION WHICH IS MAINTAINED WHETHER IT BE A TABU OR A LARGER CONVENTIONALITY THE FEATURES OF THE CONVENTIONAL SCHEME OF CONSUMPTION DO NOT CHANGE EASILY
IN THE NATURE OF THINGS LUXURIES AND THE COMFORTS OF LIFE BELONG TO THE LEISURE CLASS
UNDER THE TABU CERTAIN VICTUALS AND MORE PARTICULARLY CERTAIN BEVERAGES ARE STRICTLY RESERVED FOR THE USE OF THE SUPERIOR CLASS
DRUNKENNESS AND THE OTHER PATHOLOGICAL CONSEQUENCES OF THE FREE USE OF STIMULANTS THEREFORE TEND IN THEIR TURN TO BECOME HONORIFIC AS BEING A MARK AT THE SECOND REMOVE OF THE SUPERIOR STATUS OF THOSE WHO ARE ABLE TO AFFORD THE INDULGENCE
IT HAS EVEN HAPPENED THAT THE NAME FOR CERTAIN DISEASED CONDITIONS OF THE BODY ARISING FROM SUCH AN ORIGIN HAS PASSED INTO EVERYDAY SPEECH AS A SYNONYM FOR NOBLE OR GENTLE
THE CONSUMPTION OF LUXURIES IN THE TRUE SENSE IS A CONSUMPTION DIRECTED TO THE COMFORT OF THE CONSUMER HIMSELF AND IS THEREFORE A MARK OF THE MASTER
WITH MANY QUALIFICATIONS WITH MORE QUALIFICATIONS AS THE PATRIARCHAL TRADITION HAS GRADUALLY WEAKENED THE GENERAL RULE IS FELT TO BE RIGHT AND BINDING THAT WOMEN SHOULD CONSUME ONLY FOR THE BENEFIT OF THEIR MASTERS
THE OBJECTION OF COURSE PRESENTS ITSELF THAT EXPENDITURE ON WOMEN'S DRESS AND HOUSEHOLD PARAPHERNALIA IS AN OBVIOUS EXCEPTION TO THIS RULE BUT IT WILL APPEAR IN THE SEQUEL THAT THIS EXCEPTION IS MUCH MORE OBVIOUS THAN SUBSTANTIAL
THE CUSTOM OF FESTIVE GATHERINGS PROBABLY ORIGINATED IN MOTIVES OF CONVIVIALITY AND RELIGION THESE MOTIVES ARE ALSO PRESENT IN THE LATER DEVELOPMENT BUT THEY DO NOT CONTINUE TO BE THE SOLE MOTIVES
THERE IS A MORE OR LESS ELABORATE SYSTEM OF RANK AND GRADES
THIS DIFFERENTIATION IS FURTHERED BY THE INHERITANCE OF WEALTH AND THE CONSEQUENT INHERITANCE OF GENTILITY
MANY OF THESE AFFILIATED GENTLEMEN OF LEISURE ARE AT THE SAME TIME LESSER MEN OF SUBSTANCE IN THEIR OWN RIGHT SO THAT SOME OF THEM ARE SCARCELY AT ALL OTHERS ONLY PARTIALLY TO BE RATED AS VICARIOUS CONSUMERS
SO MANY OF THEM HOWEVER AS MAKE UP THE RETAINER AND HANGERS ON OF THE PATRON MAY BE CLASSED AS VICARIOUS CONSUMER WITHOUT QUALIFICATION
MANY OF THESE AGAIN AND ALSO MANY OF THE OTHER ARISTOCRACY OF LESS DEGREE HAVE IN TURN ATTACHED TO THEIR PERSONS A MORE OR LESS COMPREHENSIVE GROUP OF VICARIOUS CONSUMER IN THE PERSONS OF THEIR WIVES AND CHILDREN THEIR SERVANTS RETAINERS ET CETERA
THE WEARING OF UNIFORMS OR LIVERIES IMPLIES A CONSIDERABLE DEGREE OF DEPENDENCE AND MAY EVEN BE SAID TO BE A MARK OF SERVITUDE REAL OR OSTENSIBLE
THE WEARERS OF UNIFORMS AND LIVERIES MAY BE ROUGHLY DIVIDED INTO TWO CLASSES THE FREE AND THE SERVILE OR THE NOBLE AND THE IGNOBLE
BUT THE GENERAL DISTINCTION IS NOT ON THAT ACCOUNT TO BE OVERLOOKED
SO THOSE OFFICES WHICH ARE BY RIGHT THE PROPER EMPLOYMENT OF THE LEISURE CLASS ARE NOBLE SUCH AS GOVERNMENT FIGHTING HUNTING THE CARE OF ARMS AND ACCOUTREMENTS AND THE LIKE IN SHORT THOSE WHICH MAY BE CLASSED AS OSTENSIBLY PREDATORY EMPLOYMENTS
WHENEVER AS IN THESE CASES THE MENIAL SERVICE IN QUESTION HAS TO DO DIRECTLY WITH THE PRIMARY LEISURE EMPLOYMENTS OF FIGHTING AND HUNTING IT EASILY ACQUIRES A REFLECTED HONORIFIC CHARACTER
THE LIVERY BECOMES OBNOXIOUS TO NEARLY ALL WHO ARE REQUIRED TO WEAR IT
IN A GENERAL WAY THOUGH NOT WHOLLY NOR CONSISTENTLY THESE TWO GROUPS COINCIDE
THE DEPENDENT WHO WAS FIRST DELEGATED FOR THESE DUTIES WAS THE WIFE OR THE CHIEF WIFE AND AS WOULD BE EXPECTED IN THE LATER DEVELOPMENT OF THE INSTITUTION WHEN THE NUMBER OF PERSONS BY WHOM THESE DUTIES ARE CUSTOMARILY PERFORMED GRADUALLY NARROWS THE WIFE REMAINS THE LAST
BUT AS WE DESCEND THE SOCIAL SCALE THE POINT IS PRESENTLY REACHED WHERE THE DUTIES OF VICARIOUS LEISURE AND CONSUMPTION DEVOLVE UPON THE WIFE ALONE
IN THE COMMUNITIES OF THE WESTERN CULTURE THIS POINT IS AT PRESENT FOUND AMONG THE LOWER MIDDLE CLASS
IF BEAUTY OR COMFORT IS ACHIEVED AND IT IS A MORE OR LESS FORTUITOUS CIRCUMSTANCE IF THEY ARE THEY MUST BE ACHIEVED BY MEANS AND METHODS THAT COMMEND THEMSELVES TO THE GREAT ECONOMIC LAW OF WASTED EFFORT
THE MAN OF THE HOUSEHOLD ALSO CAN DO SOMETHING IN THIS DIRECTION AND INDEED HE COMMONLY DOES BUT WITH A STILL LOWER DESCENT INTO THE LEVELS OF INDIGENCE ALONG THE MARGIN OF THE SLUMS THE MAN AND PRESENTLY ALSO THE CHILDREN VIRTUALLY CEASE TO CONSUME VALUABLE GOODS FOR APPEARANCES AND THE WOMAN REMAINS VIRTUALLY THE SOLE EXPONENT OF THE HOUSEHOLD'S PECUNIARY DECENCY
VERY MUCH OF SQUALOR AND DISCOMFORT WILL BE ENDURED BEFORE THE LAST TRINKET OR THE LAST PRETENSE OF PECUNIARY DECENCY IS PUT AWAY
THERE IS NO CLASS AND NO COUNTRY THAT HAS YIELDED SO ABJECTLY BEFORE THE PRESSURE OF PHYSICAL WANT AS TO DENY THEMSELVES ALL GRATIFICATION OF THIS HIGHER OR SPIRITUAL NEED
THE QUESTION IS WHICH OF THE TWO METHODS WILL MOST EFFECTIVELY REACH THE PERSONS WHOSE CONVICTIONS IT IS DESIRED TO AFFECT
EACH WILL THEREFORE SERVE ABOUT EQUALLY WELL DURING THE EARLIER STAGES OF SOCIAL GROWTH
THE MODERN ORGANIZATION OF INDUSTRY WORKS IN THE SAME DIRECTION ALSO BY ANOTHER LINE
IT IS EVIDENT THEREFORE THAT THE PRESENT TREND OF THE DEVELOPMENT IS IN THE DIRECTION OF HEIGHTENING THE UTILITY OF CONSPICUOUS CONSUMPTION AS COMPARED WITH LEISURE
IT IS ALSO NOTICEABLE THAT THE SERVICEABILITY OF CONSUMPTION AS A MEANS OF REPUTE AS WELL AS THE INSISTENCE ON IT AS AN ELEMENT OF DECENCY IS AT ITS BEST IN THOSE PORTIONS OF THE COMMUNITY WHERE THE HUMAN CONTACT OF THE INDIVIDUAL IS WIDEST AND THE MOBILITY OF THE POPULATION IS GREATEST
CONSUMPTION BECOMES A LARGER ELEMENT IN THE STANDARD OF LIVING IN THE CITY THAN IN THE COUNTRY
AMONG THE COUNTRY POPULATION ITS PLACE IS TO SOME EXTENT TAKEN BY SAVINGS AND HOME COMFORTS KNOWN THROUGH THE MEDIUM OF NEIGHBORHOOD GOSSIP SUFFICIENTLY TO SERVE THE LIKE GENERAL PURPOSE OF PECUNIARY REPUTE
THE RESULT IS A GREAT MOBILITY OF THE LABOR EMPLOYED IN PRINTING PERHAPS GREATER THAN IN ANY OTHER EQUALLY WELL DEFINED AND CONSIDERABLE BODY OF WORKMEN
UNDER THE SIMPLE TEST OF EFFECTIVENESS FOR ADVERTISING WE SHOULD EXPECT TO FIND LEISURE AND THE CONSPICUOUS CONSUMPTION OF GOODS DIVIDING THE FIELD OF PECUNIARY EMULATION PRETTY EVENLY BETWEEN THEM AT THE OUTSET
BUT THE ACTUAL COURSE OF DEVELOPMENT HAS BEEN SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT FROM THIS IDEAL SCHEME LEISURE HELD THE FIRST PLACE AT THE START AND CAME TO HOLD A RANK VERY MUCH ABOVE WASTEFUL CONSUMPTION OF GOODS BOTH AS A DIRECT EXPONENT OF WEALTH AND AS AN ELEMENT IN THE STANDARD OF DECENCY DURING THE QUASI PEACEABLE CULTURE
OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES PERMITTING THAT INSTINCT DISPOSES MEN TO LOOK WITH FAVOR UPON PRODUCTIVE EFFICIENCY AND ON WHATEVER IS OF HUMAN USE
A RECONCILIATION BETWEEN THE TWO CONFLICTING REQUIREMENTS IS EFFECTED BY A RESORT TO MAKE BELIEVE MANY AND INTRICATE POLITE OBSERVANCES AND SOCIAL DUTIES OF A CEREMONIAL NATURE ARE DEVELOPED MANY ORGANIZATIONS ARE FOUNDED WITH SOME SPECIOUS OBJECT OF AMELIORATION EMBODIED IN THEIR OFFICIAL STYLE AND TITLE THERE IS MUCH COMING AND GOING AND A DEAL OF TALK TO THE END THAT THE TALKERS MAY NOT HAVE OCCASION TO REFLECT ON WHAT IS THE EFFECTUAL ECONOMIC VALUE OF THEIR TRAFFIC
THE SALIENT FEATURES OF THIS DEVELOPMENT OF DOMESTIC SERVICE HAVE ALREADY BEEN INDICATED
THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE EVOLUTION OF CONSPICUOUS EXPENDITURE WHETHER OF GOODS OR OF SERVICES OR HUMAN LIFE RUNS THE OBVIOUS IMPLICATION THAT IN ORDER TO EFFECTUALLY MEND THE CONSUMER'S GOOD FAME IT MUST BE AN EXPENDITURE OF SUPERFLUITIES
AS USED IN THE SPEECH OF EVERYDAY LIFE THE WORD CARRIES AN UNDERTONE OF DEPRECATION
THE USE OF THE WORD WASTE AS A TECHNICAL TERM THEREFORE IMPLIES NO DEPRECATION OF THE MOTIVES OR OF THE ENDS SOUGHT BY THE CONSUMER UNDER THIS CANON OF CONSPICUOUS WASTE
BUT IT IS ON OTHER GROUNDS WORTH NOTING THAT THE TERM WASTE IN THE LANGUAGE OF EVERYDAY LIFE IMPLIES DEPRECATION OF WHAT IS CHARACTERIZED AS WASTEFUL
IN STRICT ACCURACY NOTHING SHOULD BE INCLUDED UNDER THE HEAD OF CONSPICUOUS WASTE BUT SUCH EXPENDITURE AS IS INCURRED ON THE GROUND OF AN INVIDIOUS PECUNIARY COMPARISON
AN ARTICLE MAY BE USEFUL AND WASTEFUL BOTH AND ITS UTILITY TO THE CONSUMER MAY BE MADE UP OF USE AND WASTE IN THE MOST VARYING PROPORTIONS
YOU KNOW CAPTAIN LAKE
SAID LORD CHELFORD ADDRESSING ME
HE HAD HIS HAND UPON LAKE'S SHOULDER
THEY ARE COUSINS YOU KNOW WE ARE ALL COUSINS
WHATEVER LORD CHELFORD SAID MISS BRANDON RECEIVED IT VERY GRACIOUSLY AND EVEN WITH A MOMENTARY SMILE
BUT HER GREETING TO CAPTAIN LAKE WAS MORE THAN USUALLY HAUGHTY AND FROZEN AND HER FEATURES I FANCIED PARTICULARLY PROUD AND PALE
AT DINNER LAKE WAS EASY AND AMUSING
I'M GLAD YOU LIKE IT SAYS WYLDER CHUCKLING BENIGNANTLY ON IT OVER HIS SHOULDER
I BELIEVE I HAVE A LITTLE TASTE THAT WAY THOSE ARE ALL REAL YOU KNOW THOSE JEWELS
AND HE PLACED IT IN THAT GENTLEMAN'S FINGERS WHO NOW TOOK HIS TURN AT THE LAMP AND CONTEMPLATED THE LITTLE PARALLELOGRAM WITH A GLEAM OF SLY AMUSEMENT
I WAS THINKING IT'S VERY LIKE THE ACE OF HEARTS ANSWERED THE CAPTAIN SOFTLY SMILING ON
WHEREUPON LAKE LAUGHED QUIETLY STILL LOOKING ON THE ACE OF HEARTS WITH HIS SLY EYES
AND WYLDER LAUGHED TOO MORE SUDDENLY AND NOISILY THAN THE HUMOUR OF THE JOKE SEEMED QUITE TO CALL FOR AND GLANCED A GRIM LOOK FROM THE CORNERS OF HIS EYES ON LAKE BUT THE GALLANT CAPTAIN DID NOT SEEM TO PERCEIVE IT AND AFTER A FEW SECONDS MORE HE HANDED IT VERY INNOCENTLY BACK TO MISSUS DOROTHY ONLY REMARKING
DO YOU KNOW LAKE OH I REALLY CAN'T TELL BUT HE'LL SOON TIRE OF COUNTRY LIFE
HE'S NOT A MAN FOR COUNTRY QUARTERS
I HAD A HORRID DREAM ABOUT HIM LAST NIGHT THAT
OH I KNOW THAT'S LORNE BRANDON
ALL THE TIME HE WAS TALKING TO ME HIS ANGRY LITTLE EYES WERE FOLLOWING LAKE
IT WAS NOT VERY MUCH PAST ELEVEN THAT MORNING WHEN THE PONY CARRIAGE FROM BRANDON DREW UP BEFORE THE LITTLE GARDEN WICKET OF REDMAN'S FARM
WELL SHE WAS BETTER THOUGH SHE HAD HAD A BAD NIGHT
SO THERE CAME A STEP AND A LITTLE RUSTLING OF FEMININE DRAPERIES THE SMALL DOOR OPENED AND RACHEL ENTERED WITH HER HAND EXTENDED AND A PALE SMILE OF WELCOME
WOMEN CAN HIDE THEIR PAIN BETTER THAN WE MEN AND BEAR IT BETTER TOO EXCEPT WHEN SHAME DROPS FIRE INTO THE DREADFUL CHALICE
BUT POOR RACHEL LAKE HAD MORE THAN THAT STOICAL HYPOCRISY WHICH ENABLES THE TORTURED SPIRITS OF HER SEX TO LIFT A PALE FACE THROUGH THE FLAMES AND SMILE
THIS TRANSIENT SPRING AND LIGHTING UP ARE BEAUTIFUL A GLAMOUR BEGUILING OUR SENSES
THERE WAS SOMETHING OF SWEETNESS AND FONDNESS IN HER TONES AND MANNER WHICH WAS NEW TO RACHEL AND COMFORTING AND SHE RETURNED THE GREETING AS KINDLY AND FELT MORE LIKE HER FORMER SELF
RACHEL'S PALE AND SHARPENED FEATURES AND DILATED EYE STRUCK HER WITH A PAINFUL SURPRISE
YOU HAVE BEEN SO ILL MY POOR RACHEL
ILL AND TROUBLED DEAR TROUBLED IN MIND AND MISERABLY NERVOUS
POOR RACHEL HER NATURE RECOILED FROM DECEIT AND SHE TOLD AT ALL EVENTS AS MUCH OF THE TRUTH AS SHE DARED
SHE SPOKE WITH A SUDDEN ENERGY WHICH PARTOOK OF FEAR AND PASSION AND FLUSHED HER THIN CHEEK AND MADE HER LANGUID EYES FLASH
THANK YOU RACHEL MY COUSIN RACHEL MY ONLY FRIEND
CHELFORD HAD A NOTE FROM MISTER WYLDER THIS MORNING ANOTHER NOTE HIS COMING DELAYED AND SOMETHING OF HIS HAVING TO SEE SOME PERSON WHO IS ABROAD CONTINUED DORCAS AFTER A LITTLE PAUSE
YES SOMETHING EVERYTHING SAID RACHEL HURRIEDLY LOOKING FROWNINGLY AT A FLOWER WHICH SHE WAS TWIRLING IN HER FINGERS
YES SAID RACHEL
AND THE WAN ORACLE HAVING SPOKEN SHE SATE DOWN IN THE SAME SORT OF ABSTRACTION AGAIN BESIDE DORCAS AND SHE LOOKED FULL IN HER COUSIN'S EYES
OF MARK WYLDER I SAY THIS HIS NAME HAS BEEN FOR YEARS HATEFUL TO ME AND RECENTLY IT HAS BECOME FRIGHTFUL AND YOU WILL PROMISE ME SIMPLY THIS THAT YOU WILL NEVER ASK ME TO SPEAK AGAIN ABOUT HIM
IT IS AN ANTIPATHY AN ANTIPATHY I CANNOT GET OVER DEAR DORCAS YOU MAY THINK IT A MADNESS BUT DON'T BLAME ME
I HAVE VERY FEW TO LOVE ME NOW AND I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT LOVE ME AS I HAVE BEGUN TO LOVE YOU
AND SHE THREW HER ARMS ROUND HER COUSIN'S NECK AND BRAVE RACHEL AT LAST BURST INTO TEARS
DORCAS IN HER STRANGE WAY WAS MOVED
I LIKE YOU STILL RACHEL I'M SURE I'LL ALWAYS LIKE YOU
YOU RESEMBLE ME RACHEL YOU ARE FEARLESS AND INFLEXIBLE AND GENEROUS
YES RACHEL I DO LOVE YOU
THANK YOU DORCAS DEAR
MISS LAKE DECLINED THE CARRIAGE TO NIGHT
AND HE ADDED SOMETHING STILL LESS COMPLIMENTARY
BUT DON'T THESE VERY WISE THINGS SOMETIMES TURN OUT VERY FOOLISHLY
IN THE MEANTIME I HAD FORMED A NEW IDEA OF HER
BY THIS TIME LORD CHELFORD AND WYLDER RETURNED AND DISGUSTED RATHER WITH MYSELF I RUMINATED ON MY WANT OF GENERAL SHIP
AND HE MADE A LITTLE DIP OF HIS CANE TOWARDS BRANDON HALL OVER HIS SHOULDER
YES SO THEY SAID BUT THAT WOULD I THINK HAVE BEEN WORSE
IF A FELLOW'S BEEN A LITTLE BIT WILD HE'S BEELZEBUB AT ONCE
BRACTON'S A VERY GOOD FELLOW I CAN ASSURE YOU
I DON'T KNOW AND CAN'T SAY HOW YOU FINE GENTLEMEN DEFINE WICKEDNESS ONLY AS AN OBSCURE FEMALE I SPEAK ACCORDING TO MY LIGHTS AND HE IS GENERALLY THOUGHT THE WICKEDEST MAN IN THIS COUNTY
WELL YOU KNOW RADIE WOMEN LIKE WICKED FELLOWS IT IS CONTRAST I SUPPOSE BUT THEY DO AND I'M SURE FROM WHAT BRACTON HAS SAID TO ME I KNOW HIM INTIMATELY THAT DORCAS LIKES HIM AND I CAN'T CONCEIVE WHY THEY ARE NOT MARRIED
THEIR WALK CONTINUED SILENT FOR THE GREATER PART NEITHER WAS QUITE SATISFIED WITH THE OTHER BUT RACHEL AT LAST SAID
NOW THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE RADIE FOR I REALLY DON'T THINK I ONCE THOUGHT OF HIM ALL THIS EVENING EXCEPT JUST WHILE WE WERE TALKING
THERE WAS A BRIGHT MOONLIGHT BROKEN BY THE SHADOWS OF OVERHANGING BOUGHS AND WITHERED LEAVES AND THE MOTTLED LIGHTS AND SHADOWS GLIDED ODDLY ACROSS HIS PALE FEATURES
DON'T INSULT ME STANLEY BY TALKING AGAIN AS YOU DID THIS MORNING
WHAT I SAY IS ALTOGETHER ON YOUR OWN ACCOUNT
MARK MY WORDS YOU'LL FIND HIM TOO STRONG FOR YOU AYE AND TOO DEEP
I AM VERY UNEASY ABOUT IT WHATEVER IT IS I CAN'T HELP IT
TO MY MIND THERE HAS ALWAYS BEEN SOMETHING INEXPRESSIBLY AWFUL IN FAMILY FEUDS
THE MYSTERY OF THEIR ORIGIN THEIR CAPACITY FOR EVOLVING LATENT FACULTIES OF CRIME AND THE STEADY VITALITY WITH WHICH THEY SURVIVE THE HEARSE AND SPEAK THEIR DEEP MOUTHED MALIGNITIES IN EVERY NEW BORN GENERATION HAVE ASSOCIATED THEM SOMEHOW IN MY MIND WITH A SPELL OF LIFE EXCEEDING AND DISTINCT FROM HUMAN AND A SPECIAL SATANIC ACTION
THE FLOOR MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE SHOWED THE GREAT AGE OF THE ROOM
MY BED WAS UNEXCEPTIONABLY COMFORTABLE BUT IN MY THEN MOOD I COULD HAVE WISHED IT A GREAT DEAL MORE MODERN
ITS CURTAINS WERE OF THICK AND FADED TAPESTRY
ALL THE FURNITURE BELONGED TO OTHER TIMES
I SHAN'T TROUBLE YOU ABOUT MY TRAIN OF THOUGHTS OR FANCIES BUT I BEGAN TO FEEL VERY LIKE A GENTLEMAN IN A GHOST STORY WATCHING EXPERIMENTALLY IN A HAUNTED CHAMBER
I DID NOT EVEN TAKE THE PRECAUTION OF SMOKING UP THE CHIMNEY
I BOLDLY LIGHTED MY CHEROOT
A COLD BRIGHT MOON WAS SHINING WITH CLEAR SHARP LIGHTS AND SHADOWS
THE SOMBRE OLD TREES LIKE GIGANTIC HEARSE PLUMES BLACK AND AWFUL
SOMEHOW I HAD GROWN NERVOUS
A LITTLE BIT OF PLASTER TUMBLED DOWN THE CHIMNEY AND STARTLED ME CONFOUNDEDLY
ALSO A POPULAR CONTRIVANCE WHEREBY LOVE MAKING MAY BE SUSPENDED BUT NOT STOPPED DURING THE PICNIC SEASON
HARANGUE THE TIRESOME PRODUCT OF A TIRELESS TONGUE
ANGOR PAIN PAINFUL TO HEAR
HAY FEVER A HEART TROUBLE CAUSED BY FALLING IN LOVE WITH A GRASS WIDOW
HEAVEN A GOOD PLACE TO BE RAISED TO
HEDGE A FENCE
HEREDITY THE CAUSE OF ALL OUR FAULTS
HORSE SENSE A DEGREE OF WISDOM THAT KEEPS ONE FROM BETTING ON THE RACES
HOSE MAN'S EXCUSE FOR WETTING THE WALK
HOTEL A PLACE WHERE A GUEST OFTEN GIVES UP GOOD DOLLARS FOR POOR QUARTERS
HOUSECLEANING A DOMESTIC UPHEAVAL THAT MAKES IT EASY FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO ENLIST ALL THE SOLDIERS IT NEEDS
HUSBAND THE NEXT THING TO A WIFE
HUSSY WOMAN AND BOND TIE
TIED TO A WOMAN
HYPOCRITE A HORSE DEALER
YOU ARE MY ALL THE WORLD AND I MUST STRIVE TO KNOW MY SHAMES AND PRAISES FROM YOUR TONGUE NONE ELSE TO ME NOR I TO NONE ALIVE THAT MY STEEL'D SENSE OR CHANGES RIGHT OR WRONG
O TIS THE FIRST TIS FLATTERY IN MY SEEING AND MY GREAT MIND MOST KINGLY DRINKS IT UP MINE EYE WELL KNOWS WHAT WITH HIS GUST IS GREEING AND TO HIS PALATE DOTH PREPARE THE CUP IF IT BE POISON'D TIS THE LESSER SIN THAT MINE EYE LOVES IT AND DOTH FIRST BEGIN
BUT RECKONING TIME WHOSE MILLION'D ACCIDENTS CREEP IN TWIXT VOWS AND CHANGE DECREES OF KINGS TAN SACRED BEAUTY BLUNT THE SHARP'ST INTENTS DIVERT STRONG MINDS TO THE COURSE OF ALTERING THINGS ALAS WHY FEARING OF TIME'S TYRANNY MIGHT I NOT THEN SAY NOW I LOVE YOU BEST WHEN I WAS CERTAIN O'ER INCERTAINTY CROWNING THE PRESENT DOUBTING OF THE REST
LOVE IS A BABE THEN MIGHT I NOT SAY SO TO GIVE FULL GROWTH TO THAT WHICH STILL DOTH GROW
SO I RETURN REBUK'D TO MY CONTENT AND GAIN BY ILL THRICE MORE THAN I HAVE SPENT
IT WAS THIS OBSERVATION THAT DREW FROM DOUGLAS NOT IMMEDIATELY BUT LATER IN THE EVENING A REPLY THAT HAD THE INTERESTING CONSEQUENCE TO WHICH I CALL ATTENTION
SOMEONE ELSE TOLD A STORY NOT PARTICULARLY EFFECTIVE WHICH I SAW HE WAS NOT FOLLOWING
CRIED ONE OF THE WOMEN HE TOOK NO NOTICE OF HER HE LOOKED AT ME BUT AS IF INSTEAD OF ME HE SAW WHAT HE SPOKE OF
THERE WAS A UNANIMOUS GROAN AT THIS AND MUCH REPROACH AFTER WHICH IN HIS PREOCCUPIED WAY HE EXPLAINED
THE STORY'S WRITTEN
I COULD WRITE TO MY MAN AND ENCLOSE THE KEY HE COULD SEND DOWN THE PACKET AS HE FINDS IT
THE OTHERS RESENTED POSTPONEMENT BUT IT WAS JUST HIS SCRUPLES THAT CHARMED ME
TO THIS HIS ANSWER WAS PROMPT OH THANK GOD NO AND IS THE RECORD YOURS
HE HUNG FIRE AGAIN A WOMAN'S
SHE HAS BEEN DEAD THESE TWENTY YEARS
SHE SENT ME THE PAGES IN QUESTION BEFORE SHE DIED
SHE WAS THE MOST AGREEABLE WOMAN I'VE EVER KNOWN IN HER POSITION SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN WORTHY OF ANY WHATEVER
IT WASN'T SIMPLY THAT SHE SAID SO BUT THAT I KNEW SHE HADN'T I WAS SURE I COULD SEE
YOU'LL EASILY JUDGE WHY WHEN YOU HEAR BECAUSE THE THING HAD BEEN SUCH A SCARE HE CONTINUED TO FIX ME
YOU ARE ACUTE
HE QUITTED THE FIRE AND DROPPED BACK INTO HIS CHAIR
PROBABLY NOT TILL THE SECOND POST
IT WAS ALMOST THE TONE OF HOPE EVERYBODY WILL STAY
CRIED THE LADIES WHOSE DEPARTURE HAD BEEN FIXED
MISSUS GRIFFIN HOWEVER EXPRESSED THE NEED FOR A LITTLE MORE LIGHT
WHO WAS IT SHE WAS IN LOVE WITH THE STORY WILL TELL I TOOK UPON MYSELF TO REPLY OH I CAN'T WAIT FOR THE STORY THE STORY WON'T TELL SAID DOUGLAS NOT IN ANY LITERAL VULGAR WAY MORE'S THE PITY THEN
WON'T YOU TELL DOUGLAS
WELL IF I DON'T KNOW WHO SHE WAS IN LOVE WITH I KNOW WHO HE WAS
LET ME SAY HERE DISTINCTLY TO HAVE DONE WITH IT THAT THIS NARRATIVE FROM AN EXACT TRANSCRIPT OF MY OWN MADE MUCH LATER IS WHAT I SHALL PRESENTLY GIVE
POOR DOUGLAS BEFORE HIS DEATH WHEN IT WAS IN SIGHT COMMITTED TO ME THE MANUSCRIPT THAT REACHED HIM ON THE THIRD OF THESE DAYS AND THAT ON THE SAME SPOT WITH IMMENSE EFFECT HE BEGAN TO READ TO OUR HUSHED LITTLE CIRCLE ON THE NIGHT OF THE FOURTH
THE DEPARTING LADIES WHO HAD SAID THEY WOULD STAY DIDN'T OF COURSE THANK HEAVEN STAY THEY DEPARTED IN CONSEQUENCE OF ARRANGEMENTS MADE IN A RAGE OF CURIOSITY AS THEY PROFESSED PRODUCED BY THE TOUCHES WITH WHICH HE HAD ALREADY WORKED US UP
THE FIRST OF THESE TOUCHES CONVEYED THAT THE WRITTEN STATEMENT TOOK UP THE TALE AT A POINT AFTER IT HAD IN A MANNER BEGUN
HE HAD FOR HIS OWN TOWN RESIDENCE A BIG HOUSE FILLED WITH THE SPOILS OF TRAVEL AND THE TROPHIES OF THE CHASE BUT IT WAS TO HIS COUNTRY HOME AN OLD FAMILY PLACE IN ESSEX THAT HE WISHED HER IMMEDIATELY TO PROCEED
THE AWKWARD THING WAS THAT THEY HAD PRACTICALLY NO OTHER RELATIONS AND THAT HIS OWN AFFAIRS TOOK UP ALL HIS TIME
THERE WERE PLENTY OF PEOPLE TO HELP BUT OF COURSE THE YOUNG LADY WHO SHOULD GO DOWN AS GOVERNESS WOULD BE IN SUPREME AUTHORITY
I DON'T ANTICIPATE
SHE WAS YOUNG UNTRIED NERVOUS IT WAS A VISION OF SERIOUS DUTIES AND LITTLE COMPANY OF REALLY GREAT LONELINESS
YES BUT THAT'S JUST THE BEAUTY OF HER PASSION
IT WAS THE BEAUTY OF IT
IT SOUNDED DULL IT SOUNDED STRANGE AND ALL THE MORE SO BECAUSE OF HIS MAIN CONDITION WHICH WAS
SHE PROMISED TO DO THIS AND SHE MENTIONED TO ME THAT WHEN FOR A MOMENT DISBURDENED DELIGHTED HE HELD HER HAND THANKING HER FOR THE SACRIFICE SHE ALREADY FELT REWARDED
BUT WAS THAT ALL HER REWARD ONE OF THE LADIES ASKED
THOSE PRETTY WRONGS THAT LIBERTY COMMITS WHEN I AM SOMETIME ABSENT FROM THY HEART THY BEAUTY AND THY YEARS FULL WELL BEFITS FOR STILL TEMPTATION FOLLOWS WHERE THOU ART
AY ME
NO MATTER THEN ALTHOUGH MY FOOT DID STAND UPON THE FARTHEST EARTH REMOV'D FROM THEE FOR NIMBLE THOUGHT CAN JUMP BOTH SEA AND LAND AS SOON AS THINK THE PLACE WHERE HE WOULD BE BUT AH
THOUGHT KILLS ME THAT I AM NOT THOUGHT TO LEAP LARGE LENGTHS OF MILES WHEN THOU ART GONE BUT THAT SO MUCH OF EARTH AND WATER WROUGHT I MUST ATTEND TIME'S LEISURE WITH MY MOAN RECEIVING NOUGHT BY ELEMENTS SO SLOW BUT HEAVY TEARS BADGES OF EITHER'S WOE
MY HEART DOTH PLEAD THAT THOU IN HIM DOST LIE A CLOSET NEVER PIERC'D WITH CRYSTAL EYES BUT THE DEFENDANT DOTH THAT PLEA DENY AND SAYS IN HIM THY FAIR APPEARANCE LIES
I AM FROM THE CUTTER LYING OFF THE COAST
DON'T CRY HE SAID I WAS OBLIGED TO COME
AND AND YOU HAVE NOT FOUND OUT ANYTHING CAME IN QUICK FRIGHTENED TONES
I WISH YOU WOULD BELIEVE ME THAT I AM IN AS GREAT TROUBLE ABOUT IT AS YOU ARE
THAT MY FATHER SIR RISDON GRAEME HAS SMUGGLED GOODS HERE
HE COULD NOT HELP IT HE HATES THE SMUGGLERS YOU SHALL NOT TELL
PRAY PRAY SAY YOU WILL NOT ARCHY WAS SILENT
THEN AS ARCHY STOOD IN THE DARK LITERALLY AGHAST WITH ASTONISHMENT HE HEARD THE FAINT RUSTLING ONCE MORE AND AGAIN ALL WAS SILENT
HE LAUGHED BUT IT WAS A CURIOUS KIND OF LAUGH FULL OF VEXATION INJURED AMOUR PROPRE AS THE FRENCH CALL OUR LOVE OF OUR OWN DIGNITY OF WHICH ARCHIBALD RAYSTOKE IN THE FULL FLUSH OF HIS YOUNG BELIEF IN HIS IMPORTANCE AS A BRITISH OFFICER HAD A PRETTY GOOD STOCK
IT ALL COMES OF DRESSING UP IN THIS STUPID WAY LIKE A ROUGH FISHER LAD
COLD WATER CAME ON THIS IDEA DIRECTLY AS HE RECALLED THE FACT THAT THE DARKNESS WAS INTENSE AND CELIA COULD NOT HAVE SEEN HIM
I'LL SOON SHOW THEM THAT I AM NOT GOING TO BE PLAYED WITH
FOR IT SUDDENLY OCCURRED TO HIM THAT HE WAS NOT ONLY A PRISONER BUT A PRISONER IN THE POWER OF A VERY RECKLESS SET OF PEOPLE WHO WOULD STOP AT NOTHING
NO HE THOUGHT TO HIMSELF I DON'T BELIEVE THEY WOULD KILL ME BUT THEY WOULD KNOCK ME ABOUT
THE KICK HE HAD RECEIVED WAS A FORETASTE OF WHAT HE MIGHT EXPECT AND AFTER A LITTLE CONSIDERATION HE CAME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT HIS DUTY WAS TO ESCAPE AND GET BACK TO THE CUTTER AS QUICKLY AS HE COULD
TO DO THIS HE MUST SCHEME LIE HID TILL MORNING THEN MAKE FOR THE NEAREST POINT AND SIGNAL FOR HELP UNLESS A BOAT'S CREW WERE ALREADY SEARCHING FOR HIM HOW TO ESCAPE
THE WINDOW WAS BARRED BUT HE WENT TO IT AND TRIED THE BARS ONE BY ONE TO FIND THEM ALL SOLIDLY FITTED INTO THE STONE SILL
NEXT MOMENT AS HE FELT HIS WAY ABOUT HIS HAND TOUCHED AN OLD FASHIONED MARBLE MANTELPIECE FIREPLACE CHIMNEY
YES IF OTHER WAYS FAILED HE COULD ESCAPE UP THE CHIMNEY
NO THAT WAS TOO BAD HE COULD NOT DO THAT
SYMPATHY AND PITY FOR THE DWELLERS IN THE HOZE WERE COMPLETELY GONE NOW AND HE SET HIS TEETH FAST AND MENTALLY CALLED HIMSELF A WEAK IDIOT FOR EVER THINKING ABOUT SUCH PEOPLE
A NARROW TABLE AGAINST THE WALL IN TWO PLACES
HE WENT AND TRIED TO FORCE HIS HEAD THROUGH RECALLING AS HE DID THAT WHERE A PERSON'S HEAD WOULD GO THE REST OF THE BODY WOULD PASS
BUT THERE WAS NO CHANCE FOR HIS BODY THERE THE HEAD WOULD NOT GO FIRST
A FELLOW WHO WAS SHUT UP IN PRISON FOR LIFE MIGHT DO IT HE SAID BUT NOT IN A CASE LIKE THIS
SURE YOU'VE LOOKED ROUND EVERYWHERE BOY YES FATHER QUITE
I'M GOING HOME TO BREAKFAST
SHALL I COME TOO FATHER NO
STOP HERE TILL SIR RISDON COMES DOWN AND TELL HIM I'M VERY SORRY THAT WE SHOULD HAVE CLEARED OUT LAST NIGHT ONLY A BORN FOOL SAW JERRY NANDY'S LOBSTER BOAT COMING INTO THE COVE AND CAME RUNNING TO SAY IT WAS A PARTY FROM THE CUTTER YES FATHER
TELL HIM NOT TO BE UNEASY TIS ALL RIGHT AND I'LL HAVE EVERYTHING CLEAR AWAY TO NIGHT
THE DULL SOUND OF DEPARTING STEPS AND A LOW WHISTLING SOUND COMING DOWN THROUGH THE SKYLIGHT WINDOW INTO THE CABIN WHERE ARCHY RAYSTOKE LAY WITH HIS HEAVY EYELIDS PRESSED DOWN BY SLEEP
WHAT A QUEER DREAM HE THOUGHT TO HIMSELF
BUT HOW QUEER FOR MISTER GURR TO BE TALKING LIKE THAT TO ANDREW TEAL THE BOY WHO HELPED THE COOK
AND WHY DID ANDY CALL MISTER GURR FATHER
THERE WAS AN INTERVAL OF THINKING OVER THIS KNOTTY QUESTION DURING WHICH THE LOW WHISTLING WENT ON
AND I'M HUNGRY TOO TIME I WAS UP I SUPPOSE
NO HE WAS NOT DREAMING FOR HE WAS LOOKING OUT ON THE SEA OVER WHICH A FAINT MIST HUNG LIKE WREATHS OF SMOKE
WHAT DID THEY SAY FALSE ALARM TELL SIR RISDON THEY WOULD CLEAR ALL AWAY TO NIGHT SEE IF ANYTHING HAD BEEN LEFT ABOUT LOBSTER BOAT
ONCE OUT OF THAT ROOM HE COULD RAN AND BY DAYLIGHT THE SMUGGLERS DARE NOT HUNT HIM DOWN
OH THOSE BARS HE MENTALLY EXCLAIMED AND HE WAS ADVANCING TOWARD THEM WHEN JUST AS HE DREW NEAR THERE WAS A RUSTLING NOISE UNDER THE WINDOW A COUPLE OF HANDS SEIZED THE BARS THERE WAS A SCRATCHING OF BOOT TOES AGAINST STONE WORK AND RAM'S FACE APPEARED TO GAZE INTO THE ROOM BY INTENTION BUT INTO THE ASTONISHED COUNTENANCE OF THE YOUNG MIDSHIPMAN INSTEAD
RAM WAS THE FIRST TO RECOVER FROM HIS SURPRISE
HULLO HE SAID WHO ARE YOU
GO ROUND AND OPEN THE DOOR I WAS SHUT IN LAST NIGHT BY MISTAKE
I SAW YOU LAST NIGHT AND WONDERED WHOSE BOY YOU WAS
IT WAS YOU FATHER KICKED FOR SHIRKING AND MY WELL I HARDLY KNOWED YOU
NONSENSE
WON'T DO SAID RAM GRINNING
THINK I DON'T KNOW YOU MISTER ORFICER
WON'T DO SAID RAM QUICKLY I KNOW YOU
BEEN PLAYING THE SPY THAT'S WHAT YOU'VE BEEN DOING WHO LOCKED YOU IN
ARCHY STEPPED BACK TO THE DOOR LISTENING BUT THERE WAS NOT A SOUND
HE HAS GONE TO GIVE THE ALARM THOUGHT THE PRISONER AND HE LOOKED EXCITEDLY ROUND FOR A WAY OF ESCAPE
NOTHING BUT THE CHIMNEY PRESENTED ITSELF
A HAPPY INSPIRATION HAD COME AND PLACING ONE HAND UPON HIS BREAST HE THRUST IN THE OTHER GAVE A TUG AND DREW OUT HIS LITTLE CURVED DIRK GLANCED AT THE EDGE RAN TO THE WINDOW AND BEGAN TO CUT AT ONE OF THE BARS LABOUR IN VAIN
HE DIVIDED THE PAINT AND PRODUCED A FEW SQUEAKS AND GRATING SOUNDS AS HE REALISED THAT THE ATTEMPT WAS MADNESS
THE RESULT WAS NOT VERY SATISFACTORY BUT SUFFICIENTLY SO TO MAKE HIM ESSAY THE BAR OF THE WINDOW ONCE MORE PRODUCING A GRATING EAR ASSAILING SOUND AS HE FOUND THAT NOW HE DID MAKE A LITTLE IMPRESSION SO LITTLE THOUGH THAT THE PROBABILITY WAS IF HE KEPT ON WORKING WELL FOR TWENTY FOUR HOURS HE WOULD NOT GET THROUGH
BUT AT THE END OF FIVE MINUTES HE STOPPED AND THRUST BACK THE DIRK INTO ITS SHEATH
NO I CAN'T PART WITH THAT HA HA HA LAUGHED THE BOY JEERINGLY
BUT I'LL YES I'LL GIVE YOU A GUINEA IF YOU WILL LET ME OUT
GUINEA SAID THE BOY THINK I'D DO IT FOR A GUINEA WELL THEN TWO
BE QUICK THERE'S A GOOD FELLOW I WANT TO GET AWAY AT ONCE
NOT YOU ONLY A SHAM
WHY YOUR CLOTHES DON'T FIT YOU AND YOUR CAP'S PUT ON ALL SKEW REW
NEVER MIND ABOUT THAT LET ME OUT OF THIS PLACE
I TOLD YOU A FISHER BOY CRIED ARCHY IMPATIENTLY BUT TRYING NOT TO OFFEND HIS VISITOR WHO POSSESSED THE POWER OF CONFERRING FREEDOM BY SPEAKING SHARPLY
NOT YOU LOOK LIKE A WILD BEAST IN A CAGE LIKE A MONKEY YOU INSOLENT
ARCHY CHECKED HIMSELF AND THE BOY LAUGHED
IT WAS YOUR TURN YESTERDAY IT'S MINE TO DAY WHAT A GAME
YOU LAUGHED AND FLEERED AT ME WHEN I WAS ON THE CUTTER'S DECK
I SAY YOU DO LOOK A RUM UN JUST LIKE A BIG MONKEY IN A SHOW
RAM SHOWED HIS WHITE TEETH AS HE BURST OUT WITH A LONG LOW FIT OF LAUGHTER
YOU ROPE'S END ME HE SAID
WHY I COULD TIE YOU UP IN A KNOT AND HEAVE YOU OFF THE CLIFF ANY DAY WHAT A GAME
BIT OF A MIDDY FED ON SALT TACK AND WEEVILLY BISCUIT TALK OF GIVING ME ROPE'S END
ONCE MORE WILL YOU COME AND LET ME OUT NO
TO HIS ASTONISHMENT THE BOY DID NOT FLINCH BUT THRUST HIS OWN ARMS THROUGH PLACING THEM ABOUT THE MIDDY'S WAIST CLENCHING HIS HANDS BEHIND AND UTTERING A SHARP WHISTLE
SEEMED IN GOOD SPIRITS LAST NIGHT MISTER GURR EH
YES SIR BUT HE MAY TURN UP ON THE CLIFF AT ANY MOMENT

SOON AS THE SIGNAL COMES WE SHALL PUSH OFF
AWKWARD BIT O COUNTRY SIR SIX MILES ROW BEFORE YOU CAN FIND A PLACE TO LAND

NOW THEN WHY DO YOU WANT TO GO ASHORE
BEG PARDON DIDN'T MEAN NOWT SIR SAID THE SAILOR TOUCHING HIS FORELOCK
YES SIR SAID THE MAN HUMBLY SHALL I GO AT ONCE SIR
NO WAIT
KEEP A SHARP LOOK OUT ON THE CLIFF TO SEE IF MISTER RAYSTOKE IS MAKING SIGNALS FOR A BOAT
HE SWUNG ROUND WALKED AFT AND BEGAN SWEEPING THE SHORE AGAIN WITH HIS GLASS WHILE THE MASTER AND DICK EXCHANGED GLANCES WHICH MEANT A GREAT DEAL
AT LAST THE LITTLE LIEUTENANT COULD BEAR THE ANXIETY NO LONGER
PIPE AWAY THE MEN TO THAT BOAT THERE HE SAID AND AS THE CREW SPRANG IN
NOW MISTER GURR HE SAID I'M ONLY GOING TO SAY ONE THING TO YOU IN THE WAY OF INSTRUCTIONS YES SIR
BEG PARDON SIR SAID THE MASTER DEPRECATINGLY
STEADY MY LADS STEADY CRIED THE MASTER KEEP STROKE AND THEN HE BEGAN TO MAKE PLANS AS TO HIS FIRST PROCEEDINGS ON GETTING ASHORE
SAY MESTER GURR SAID DICK AFTER ONE OF THESE SEARCHES HE WOULDN'T RUN AWAY WHAT
MISTER RAYSTOKE SIR DON'T BE A FOOL
WHAT CHUCKED HIM OFF YONDER
GURR GLANCED ROUND TO SEE IF THE MEN WERE LOOKING AND THEN SAID RATHER HUSKILY BUT KINDLY
AH EJACULATED DICK SADLY
SAY MESTER GURR SIR WHICH THANKFUL I AM TO YOU FOR SPEAKING SO BUT YOU DON'T REALLY THINK AS HE HAS COME TO HARM
I HOPE NOT DICK I HOPE NOT BUT SMUGGLERS DON'T STAND AT ANYTHING SOMETIMES
I DO ASSURE YOU THERE'S NOTHING HERE BUT WHAT YOU MAY SEE
IF YOU'D LET ME FINISH YOU'D KNOW SAID GURR GRUFFLY ONE OF OUR BOYS IS MISSING SEEN HIM UP HERE
BOY BOUT SEVENTEEN WITH A RED CAP NO SIR INDEED I'VE NOT
DON'T KNOW AS HE HAS BEEN SEEN ABOUT HERE DO YOU SAID GURR LOOKING AT HER SEARCHINGLY NO SIR
IF SHE KNEW EVIL HAD COME TO THE POOR LAD HER FACE WOULD TELL TALES LIKE PRINT
I SAID A LAD BOUT SEVENTEEN IN A RED CAP LIKE YOURS SAID GURR VERY SHORTLY
THE MAN SHOOK HIS HEAD AND STARED AS IF HE DIDN'T HALF UNDERSTAND THE DRIFT OF WHAT WAS SAID
HERE MY LAD WHERE'S YOUR MASTER
EH I SAY WHERE'S YOUR MASTER
GURR TURNED AWAY IMPATIENTLY AGAIN AND SIGNING TO HIS MEN TO FOLLOW THEY ALL BEGAN TO TRAMP UP THE STEEP TRACK LEADING TOWARD THE HOZE WITH THE RABBITS SCUTTLING AWAY AMONG THE FURZE AND SHOWING THEIR WHITE COTTONY TAILS FOR A MOMENT AS THEY DARTED DOWN INTO THEIR HOLES
I DUNNO MUTTERED DICK AND A MAN CAN'T BE SURE
GURR SALUTED AND STATED HIS BUSINESS WHILE THE BARONET WHO HAD TURNED SALLOWER AND MORE CAREWORN THAN HIS LOT DREW A BREATH FULL OF RELIEF ONE OF YOUR SHIP BOYS HE SAID
A LAD LOOKING LIKE A COMMON SAILOR AND WEARING A RED CAP NO SAID SIR RISDON
I HAVE SEEN NO ONE ANSWERING TO THE DESCRIPTION HERE
BEG PARDON SIR BUT CAN YOU AS A GENTLEMAN ASSURE ME THAT HE IS NOT HERE CERTAINLY SAID SIR RISDON
SURELY CRIED SIR RISDON EXCITEDLY
SIR RISDON WAS SILENT
LADY GRAEME LOOKED GHASTLY
YOU DO NOT KNOW NO
THEN I TOOK UP A GREAT STONE FROM AMONG THE TREES AND COMING UP TO HIM SMOTE HIM THEREWITH ON THE HEAD WITH ALL MY MIGHT AND CRUSHED IN HIS SKULL AS HE LAY DEAD DRUNK
BEHOLD A SHIP WAS MAKING FOR THE ISLAND THROUGH THE DASHING SEA AND CLASHING WAVES
HEARING THIS I WAS SORE TROUBLED REMEMBERING WHAT I HAD BEFORE SUFFERED FROM THE APE KIND
UPON THIS HE BROUGHT ME A COTTON BAG AND GIVING IT TO ME SAID TAKE THIS BAG AND FILL IT WITH PEBBLES FROM THE BEACH AND GO FORTH WITH A COMPANY OF THE TOWNSFOLK TO WHOM I WILL GIVE A CHARGE RESPECTING THEE
DO AS THEY DO AND BELIKE THOU SHALT GAIN WHAT MAY FURTHER THY RETURN VOYAGE TO THY NATIVE LAND
THEN HE CARRIED ME TO THE BEACH WHERE I FILLED MY BAG WITH PEBBLES LARGE AND SMALL AND PRESENTLY WE SAW A COMPANY OF FOLK ISSUE FROM THE TOWN EACH BEARING A BAG LIKE MINE FILLED WITH PEBBLES
TO THESE HE COMMITTED ME COMMENDING ME TO THEIR CARE AND SAYING THIS MAN IS A STRANGER SO TAKE HIM WITH YOU AND TEACH HIM HOW TO GATHER THAT HE MAY GET HIS DAILY BREAD AND YOU WILL EARN YOUR REWARD AND RECOMPENSE IN HEAVEN
NOW SLEEPING UNDER THESE TREES WERE MANY APES WHICH WHEN THEY SAW US ROSE AND FLED FROM US AND SWARMED UP AMONG THE BRANCHES WHEREUPON MY COMPANIONS BEGAN TO PELT THEM WITH WHAT THEY HAD IN THEIR BAGS AND THE APES FELL TO PLUCKING OF THE FRUIT OF THE TREES AND CASTING THEM AT THE FOLK
WE WEIGHED ANCHOR AND SHAHRAZAD PERCEIVED THE DAWN OF DAY AND CEASED SAYING HER PERMITTED SAY
WHEN IT WAS THE FIVE HUNDRED AND FIFTY NINTH NIGHT
AND CEASED NOT SAILING TILL WE ARRIVED SAFELY AT BASSORAH
THERE I ABODE A LITTLE AND THEN WENT ON TO BAGHDAD WHERE I ENTERED MY QUARTER AND FOUND MY HOUSE AND FOREGATHERED WITH MY FAMILY AND SALUTED MY FRIENDS WHO GAVE ME JOY OF MY SAFE RETURN AND I LAID UP ALL MY GOODS AND VALUABLES IN MY STOREHOUSES
AFTER WHICH I RETURNED TO MY OLD MERRY WAY OF LIFE AND FORGOT ALL I HAD SUFFERED IN THE GREAT PROFIT AND GAIN I HAD MADE
NEXT MORNING AS SOON AS IT WAS LIGHT HE PRAYED THE DAWN PRAYER AND AFTER BLESSING MOHAMMED THE CREAM OF ALL CREATURES BETOOK HIMSELF TO THE HOUSE OF SINDBAD THE SEAMAN AND WISHED HIM A GOOD DAY
HERE I FOUND A GREAT SHIP READY FOR SEA AND FULL OF MERCHANTS AND NOTABLES WHO HAD WITH THEM GOODS OF PRICE SO I EMBARKED MY BALES THEREIN
HAPLY AMONGST YOU IS ONE RIGHTEOUS WHOSE PRAYERS THE LORD WILL ACCEPT
PRESENTLY THE SHIP STRUCK THE MOUNTAIN AND BROKE UP AND ALL AND EVERYTHING ON BOARD OF HER WERE PLUNGED INTO THE SEA
BUT IT BURNETH IN THEIR BELLIES SO THEY CAST IT UP AGAIN AND IT CONGEALETH ON THE SURFACE OF THE WATER WHEREBY ITS COLOR AND QUANTITIES ARE CHANGED AND AT LAST THE WAVES CAST IT ASHORE AND THE TRAVELLERS AND MERCHANTS WHO KNOW IT COLLECT IT AND SELL IT
EACH THAT DIED WE WASHED AND SHROUDED IN SOME OF THE CLOTHES AND LINEN CAST ASHORE BY THE TIDES AND AFTER A LITTLE THE REST OF MY FELLOWS PERISHED ONE BY ONE TILL I HAD BURIED THE LAST OF THE PARTY AND ABODE ALONE ON THE ISLAND WITH BUT A LITTLE PROVISION LEFT I WHO WAS WONT TO HAVE SO MUCH
BUT THERE IS MAJESTY AND THERE IS NO MIGHT SAVE IN ALLAH THE GLORIOUS THE GREAT
WHEN IT WAS THE FIVE HUNDRED AND SIXTY FIRST NIGHT
THEN SIGHING FOR MYSELF I SET TO WORK COLLECTING A NUMBER OF PIECES OF CHINESE AND COMORIN ALOES WOOD AND I BOUND THEM TOGETHER WITH ROPES FROM THE WRECKAGE THEN I CHOSE OUT FROM THE BROKEN UP SHIPS STRAIGHT PLANKS OF EVEN SIZE AND FIXED THEM FIRMLY UPON THE ALOES WOOD MAKING ME A BOAT RAFT A LITTLE NARROWER THAN THE CHANNEL OF THE STREAM AND I TIED IT TIGHTLY AND FIRMLY AS THOUGH IT WERE NAILED
LAND AFTER LAND SHALT THOU SEEK AND FIND BUT NO OTHER LIFE ON THY WISH SHALL WAIT FRET NOT THY SOUL IN THY THOUGHTS O NIGHT ALL WOES SHALL END OR SOONER OR LATE
I ROWED MY CONVEYANCE INTO THE PLACE WHICH WAS INTENSELY DARK AND THE CURRENT CARRIED THE RAFT WITH IT DOWN THE UNDERGROUND CHANNEL
AND I THREW MYSELF DOWN UPON MY FACE ON THE RAFT BY REASON OF THE NARROWNESS OF THE CHANNEL WHILST THE STREAM CEASED NOT TO CARRY ME ALONG KNOWING NOT NIGHT FROM DAY FOR THE EXCESS OF THE GLOOM WHICH ENCOMPASSED ME ABOUT AND MY TERROR AND CONCERN FOR MYSELF LEST I SHOULD PERISH
WHEN I AWOKE AT LAST I FOUND MYSELF IN THE LIGHT OF HEAVEN AND OPENING MY EYES I SAW MYSELF IN A BROAD STREAM AND THE RAFT MOORED TO AN ISLAND IN THE MIDST OF A NUMBER OF INDIANS AND ABYSSINIANS
BUT I WAS DELIGHTED AT MY ESCAPE FROM THE RIVER
WHEN THEY SAW I UNDERSTOOD THEM NOT AND MADE THEM NO ANSWER ONE OF THEM CAME FORWARD AND SAID TO ME IN ARABIC PEACE BE WITH THEE O MY BROTHER
O MY BROTHER ANSWERED HE WE ARE HUSBANDMEN AND TILLERS OF THE SOIL WHO CAME OUT TO WATER OUR FIELDS AND PLANTATIONS AND FINDING THEE ASLEEP ON THIS RAFT LAID HOLD OF IT AND MADE IT FAST BY US AGAINST THOU SHOULDST AWAKE AT THY LEISURE
I ANSWERED FOR ALLAH'S SAKE O MY LORD ERE I SPEAK GIVE ME SOMEWHAT TO EAT FOR I AM STARVING AND AFTER ASK ME WHAT THOU WILT
WHEN IT WAS THE FIVE HUNDRED AND SIXTY SECOND NIGHT
SHE SAID IT HATH REACHED ME O AUSPICIOUS KING THAT SINDBAD THE SEAMAN CONTINUED WHEN I LANDED AND FOUND MYSELF AMONGST THE INDIANS AND ABYSSINIANS AND HAD TAKEN SOME REST THEY CONSULTED AMONG THEMSELVES AND SAID TO ONE ANOTHER THERE IS NO HELP FOR IT BUT WE CARRY HIM WITH US AND PRESENT HIM TO OUR KING THAT HE MAY ACQUAINT HIM WITH HIS ADVENTURES
SO I CONSORTED WITH THE CHIEF OF THE ISLANDERS AND THEY PAID ME THE UTMOST RESPECT
SO I ROSE WITHOUT STAY OR DELAY AND KISSED THE KING'S HAND AND ACQUAINTED HIM WITH MY LONGING TO SET OUT WITH THE MERCHANTS FOR THAT I PINED AFTER MY PEOPLE AND MINE OWN LAND
QUOTH HE THOU ART THINE OWN MASTER YET IF IT BE THY WILL TO ABIDE WITH US ON OUR HEAD AND EYES BE IT FOR THOU GLADDENEST US WITH THY COMPANY
BY ALLAH O MY LORD ANSWERED I THOU HAST INDEED OVERWHELMED ME WITH THY FAVOURS AND WELL DOINGS BUT I WEARY FOR A SIGHT OF MY FRIENDS AND FAMILY AND NATIVE COUNTRY
THEN I TOOK LEAVE OF HIM AND OF ALL MY INTIMATES AND ACQUAINTANCES IN THE ISLAND AND EMBARKED WITH THE MERCHANTS AFORESAID
HE ASKED ME WHENCE THEY CAME AND I SAID TO HIM BY ALLAH O COMMANDER OF THE FAITHFUL I KNOW NOT THE NAME OF THE CITY NOR THE WAY THITHER
FOR STATE PROCESSIONS A THRONE IS SET FOR HIM UPON A HUGE ELEPHANT ELEVEN CUBITS HIGH AND UPON THIS HE SITTETH HAVING HIS GREAT LORDS AND OFFICERS AND GUESTS STANDING IN TWO RANKS ON HIS RIGHT HAND AND ON HIS LEFT
HIS LETTER HATH SHOWN ME THIS AND AS FOR THE MIGHTINESS OF HIS DOMINION THOU HAST TOLD US WHAT THOU HAST EYE WITNESSED
PRESENTLY MY FRIENDS CAME TO ME AND I DISTRIBUTED PRESENTS AMONG MY FAMILY AND GAVE ALMS AND LARGESSE AFTER WHICH I YIELDED MYSELF TO JOYANCE AND ENJOYMENT MIRTH AND MERRY MAKING AND FORGOT ALL THAT I HAD SUFFERED
SUCH THEN O MY BROTHERS IS THE HISTORY OF WHAT BEFEL ME IN MY SIXTH VOYAGE AND TO MORROW INSHALLAH
I WILL TELL YOU THE STORY OF MY SEVENTH AND LAST VOYAGE WHICH IS STILL MORE WONDROUS AND MARVELLOUS THAN THAT OF THE FIRST SIX
WHEN IT WAS THE FIVE HUNDRED AND SIXTY THIRD NIGHT
SHE SAID IT HATH REACHED ME O AUSPICIOUS KING THAT WHEN SINDBAD THE SEAMAN HAD RELATED THE HISTORY OF WHAT BEFEL HIM IN HIS SIXTH VOYAGE AND ALL THE COMPANY HAD DISPERSED SINDBAD THE LANDSMAN WENT HOME AND SLEPT AS OF WONT
THE SEVENTH VOYAGE OF SINDBAD THE SEAMAN
KNOW O COMPANY THAT AFTER MY RETURN FROM MY SIXTH VOYAGE WHICH BROUGHT ME ABUNDANT PROFIT I RESUMED MY FORMER LIFE IN ALL POSSIBLE JOYANCE AND ENJOYMENT AND MIRTH AND MAKING MERRY DAY AND NIGHT AND I TARRIED SOME TIME IN THIS SOLACE AND SATISFACTION TILL MY SOUL BEGAN ONCE MORE TO LONG TO SAIL THE SEAS AND SEE FOREIGN COUNTRIES AND COMPANY WITH MERCHANTS AND HEAR NEW THINGS
SO HAVING MADE UP MY MIND I PACKED UP IN BALES A QUANTITY OF PRECIOUS STUFFS SUITED FOR SEA TRADE AND REPAIRED WITH THEM FROM BAGHDAD CITY TO BASSORAH TOWN WHERE I FOUND A SHIP READY FOR SEA AND IN HER A COMPANY OF CONSIDERABLE MERCHANTS
BUT THE CAPTAIN AROSE AND TIGHTENING HIS GIRDLE TUCKED UP HIS SKIRTS AND AFTER TAKING REFUGE WITH ALLAH FROM SATAN THE STONED CLOMB TO THE MAST HEAD WHENCE HE LOOKED OUT RIGHT AND LEFT AND GAZING AT THE PASSENGERS AND CREW FELL TO BUFFETING HIS FACE AND PLUCKING OUT HIS BEARD
THIS HE SET IN A SAUCER WETTED WITH A LITTLE WATER AND AFTER WAITING A SHORT TIME SMELT AND TASTED IT AND THEN HE TOOK OUT OF THE CHEST A BOOKLET WHEREIN HE READ AWHILE AND SAID WEEPING KNOW O YE PASSENGERS THAT IN THIS BOOK IS A MARVELLOUS MATTER DENOTING THAT WHOSO COMETH HITHER SHALL SURELY DIE WITHOUT HOPE OF ESCAPE FOR THAT THIS OCEAN IS CALLED THE SEA OF THE CLIME OF THE KING WHEREIN IS THE SEPULCHRE OF OUR LORD SOLOMON SON OF DAVID ON BOTH BE PEACE
A SECOND FISH MADE ITS APPEARANCE THAN WHICH WE HAD SEEN NAUGHT MORE MONSTROUS
WHEN SUDDENLY A VIOLENT SQUALL OF WIND AROSE AND SMOTE THE SHIP WHICH ROSE OUT OF THE WATER AND SETTLED UPON A GREAT REEF THE HAUNT OF SEA MONSTERS WHERE IT BROKE UP AND FELL ASUNDER INTO PLANKS AND ALL AND EVERYTHING ON BOARD WERE PLUNGED INTO THE SEA
ALTHOUGH THE PLAGUE WAS THERE IN THE MOST PART OF ALL THE HOUSES THEY NEVERTHELESS ENTERED EVERYWHERE THEN PLUNDERED AND CARRIED AWAY ALL THAT WAS WITHIN AND YET FOR ALL THIS NOT ONE OF THEM TOOK ANY HURT WHICH IS A MOST WONDERFUL CASE
I BESEECH YOU THINK UPON IT
NEVERTHELESS AT ALL ADVENTURES THEY RANG THE BELLS AD CAPITULUM CAPITULANTES
BY THE VIRTUE OF GOD WHY DO NOT YOU SING PANNIERS FAREWELL VINTAGE IS DONE
BY THE BELLY OF SANCT JAMES WHAT SHALL WE POOR DEVILS DRINK THE WHILE
LORD GOD DA MIHI POTUM
LET HIM BE CARRIED TO PRISON FOR TROUBLING THE DIVINE SERVICE
WHEREFORE IS IT THAT OUR DEVOTIONS WERE INSTITUTED TO BE SHORT IN THE TIME OF HARVEST AND VINTAGE AND LONG IN THE ADVENT AND ALL THE WINTER
HARK YOU MY MASTERS YOU THAT LOVE THE WINE COP'S BODY FOLLOW ME FOR SANCT ANTHONY BURN ME AS FREELY AS A FAGGOT IF THEY GET LEAVE TO TASTE ONE DROP OF THE LIQUOR THAT WILL NOT NOW COME AND FIGHT FOR RELIEF OF THE VINE
TO OTHERS AGAIN HE UNJOINTED THE SPONDYLES OR KNUCKLES OF THE NECK DISFIGURED THEIR CHAPS GASHED THEIR FACES MADE THEIR CHEEKS HANG FLAPPING ON THEIR CHIN AND SO SWINGED AND BALAMMED THEM THAT THEY FELL DOWN BEFORE HIM LIKE HAY BEFORE A MOWER
TO SOME WITH A SMART SOUSE ON THE EPIGASTER HE WOULD MAKE THEIR MIDRIFF SWAG THEN REDOUBLING THE BLOW GAVE THEM SUCH A HOMEPUSH ON THE NAVEL THAT HE MADE THEIR PUDDINGS TO GUSH OUT
BELIEVE THAT IT WAS THE MOST HORRIBLE SPECTACLE THAT EVER ONE SAW
O THE HOLY LADY NYTOUCH SAID ONE THE GOOD SANCTESS O OUR LADY OF SUCCOURS SAID ANOTHER HELP HELP
SOME DIED WITHOUT SPEAKING OTHERS SPOKE WITHOUT DYING SOME DIED IN SPEAKING OTHERS SPOKE IN DYING
CAN YOU TELL WITH WHAT INSTRUMENTS THEY DID IT
IN THE MEANTIME FRIAR JOHN WITH HIS FORMIDABLE BATON OF THE CROSS GOT TO THE BREACH WHICH THE ENEMIES HAD MADE AND THERE STOOD TO SNATCH UP THOSE THAT ENDEAVOURED TO ESCAPE
DRAW REACH FILL MIX GIVE IT ME WITHOUT WATER
SO MY FRIEND SO WHIP ME OFF THIS GLASS NEATLY BRING ME HITHER SOME CLARET A FULL WEEPING GLASS TILL IT RUN OVER
A CESSATION AND TRUCE WITH THIRST
YOU HAVE CATCHED A COLD GAMMER YEA FORSOOTH SIR
BY THE BELLY OF SANCT BUFF LET US TALK OF OUR DRINK I NEVER DRINK BUT AT MY HOURS LIKE THE POPE'S MULE
WHICH WAS FIRST THIRST OR DRINKING
WHAT IT SEEMS I DO NOT DRINK BUT BY AN ATTORNEY
DRINK ALWAYS AND YOU SHALL NEVER DIE
IF I DRINK NOT I AM A GROUND DRY GRAVELLED AND SPENT I AM STARK DEAD WITHOUT DRINK AND MY SOUL READY TO FLY INTO SOME MARSH AMONGST FROGS THE SOUL NEVER DWELLS IN A DRY PLACE DROUTH KILLS IT
HE DRINKS IN VAIN THAT FEELS NOT THE PLEASURE OF IT
IT IS ENOUGH TO BREAK BOTH GIRDS AND PETREL
WHAT DIFFERENCE IS THERE BETWEEN A BOTTLE AND A FLAGON
BRAVELY AND WELL PLAYED UPON THE WORDS
OUR FATHERS DRANK LUSTILY AND EMPTIED THEIR CANS
WELL CACKED WELL SUNG
COME LET US DRINK WILL YOU SEND NOTHING TO THE RIVER
I DRINK NO MORE THAN A SPONGE
I DRINK LIKE A TEMPLAR KNIGHT
AND I TANQUAM SPONSUS
AND I SICUT TERRA SINE AQUA
GIVE ME A SYNONYMON FOR A GAMMON OF BACON
IT IS THE COMPULSORY OF DRINKERS IT IS A PULLEY
A LITTLE RAIN ALLAYS A GREAT DEAL OF WIND LONG TIPPLING BREAKS THE THUNDER
BUT IF THERE CAME SUCH LIQUOR FROM MY BALLOCK WOULD YOU NOT WILLINGLY THEREAFTER SUCK THE UDDER WHENCE IT ISSUED
HERE PAGE FILL
I APPEAL FROM THIRST AND DISCLAIM ITS JURISDICTION
I WAS WONT HERETOFORE TO DRINK OUT ALL BUT NOW I LEAVE NOTHING
HEYDAY HERE ARE TRIPES FIT FOR OUR SPORT AND IN EARNEST EXCELLENT GODEBILLIOS OF THE DUN OX YOU KNOW WITH THE BLACK STREAK
O FOR GOD'S SAKE LET US LASH THEM SOUNDLY YET THRIFTILY
SPARROWS WILL NOT EAT UNLESS YOU BOB THEM ON THE TAIL NOR CAN I DRINK IF I BE NOT FAIRLY SPOKE TO
HO THIS WILL BANG IT SOUNDLY
BUT THIS SHALL BANISH IT UTTERLY
LET US WIND OUR HORNS BY THE SOUND OF FLAGONS AND BOTTLES AND CRY ALOUD THAT WHOEVER HATH LOST HIS THIRST COME NOT HITHER TO SEEK IT
THE GREAT GOD MADE THE PLANETS AND WE MAKE THE PLATTERS NEAT
APPETITE COMES WITH EATING SAYS ANGESTON BUT THE THIRST GOES AWAY WITH DRINKING
I HAVE A REMEDY AGAINST THIRST QUITE CONTRARY TO THAT WHICH IS GOOD AGAINST THE BITING OF A MAD DOG
WHITE WINE HERE WINE BOYS
O LACHRYMA CHRISTI IT IS OF THE BEST GRAPE
I'FAITH PURE GREEK GREEK O THE FINE WHITE WINE
THERE IS NO ENCHANTMENT NOR CHARM THERE EVERY ONE OF YOU HATH SEEN IT
MY PRENTICESHIP IS OUT I AM A FREE MAN AT THIS TRADE
I SHOULD SAY MASTER PAST
O THE DRINKERS THOSE THAT ARE A DRY O POOR THIRSTY SOULS
CLEAR OFF NEAT SUPERNACULUM
IT IS SIGNIFICANT TO NOTE IN THIS CONNECTION THAT THE NEW KING WAS AN UNSWERVING ADHERENT OF THE CULT OF ASHUR BY THE ADHERENTS OF WHICH HE WAS PROBABLY STRONGLY SUPPORTED
AT THE BEGINNING OF HIS REIGN THERE WAS MUCH SOCIAL DISCONTENT AND SUFFERING
WELL MIGHT SHARDURIS EXCLAIM IN THE WORDS OF THE PROPHET WHERE IS THE KING OF ARPAD
TIGLATH PILESER HOWEVER CROSSED THE EUPHRATES AND MOVING NORTHWARD DELIVERED AN UNEXPECTED ATTACK ON THE URARTIAN ARMY IN QUMMUKH
A FIERCE BATTLE ENSUED AND ONE OF ITS DRAMATIC INCIDENTS WAS A SINGLE COMBAT BETWEEN THE RIVAL KINGS
AN ATTEMPT WAS MADE TO CAPTURE KING SHARDURIS WHO LEAPT FROM HIS CHARIOT AND MADE HASTY ESCAPE ON HORSEBACK HOTLY PURSUED IN THE GATHERING DARKNESS BY AN ASSYRIAN CONTINGENT OF CAVALRY
DESPITE THE BLOW DEALT AGAINST URARTU ASSYRIA DID NOT IMMEDIATELY REGAIN POSSESSION OF NORTH SYRIA
THE SHIFTY MATI ILU EITHER CHERISHED THE HOPE THAT SHARDURIS WOULD RECOVER STRENGTH AND AGAIN INVADE NORTH SYRIA OR THAT HE MIGHT HIMSELF ESTABLISH AN EMPIRE IN THAT REGION
TIGLATH PILESER HAD THEREFORE TO MARCH WESTWARD AGAIN
FOR THREE YEARS HE CONDUCTED VIGOROUS CAMPAIGNS IN THE WESTERN LAND WHERE HE MET WITH VIGOROUS RESISTANCE
ARPAD WAS CAPTURED AND MATI ILU DEPOSED AND PROBABLY PUT TO DEATH
ONCE AGAIN THE HEBREWS CAME INTO CONTACT WITH ASSYRIA
ITS FALL MAY NOT HAVE BEEN UNCONNECTED WITH THE TREND OF EVENTS IN ASSYRIA DURING THE CLOSING YEARS OF THE MIDDLE EMPIRE
JEHOASH THE GRANDSON OF JEHU HAD ACHIEVED SUCCESSES IN CONFLICT WITH DAMASCUS
SIX MONTHS AFTERWARDS HE WAS ASSASSINATED BY SHALLUM
THIS USURPER HELD SWAY AT SAMARIA FOR ONLY A MONTH
NO RESISTANCE WAS POSSIBLE ON THE PART OF MENAHEM THE USURPER WHO WAS PROBABLY READY TO WELCOME THE ASSYRIAN CONQUEROR SO THAT BY ARRANGING AN ALLIANCE HE MIGHT SECURE HIS OWN POSITION
TIGLATH PILESER NEXT OPERATED AGAINST THE MEDIAN AND OTHER HILL TRIBES IN THE NORTH EAST
HE OVERTHREW BUILDINGS DESTROYED ORCHARDS AND TRANSPORTED TO NINEVEH THOSE OF THE INHABITANTS HE HAD NOT PUT TO THE SWORD WITH ALL THE LIVE STOCK HE COULD LAY HANDS ON
THUS WAS URARTU CRIPPLED AND HUMILIATED IT NEVER REGAINED ITS FORMER PRESTIGE AMONG THE NORTHERN STATES
IN THE FOLLOWING YEAR TIGLATH PILESER RETURNED TO SYRIA
MENAHEM KING OF ISRAEL HAD DIED AND WAS SUCCEEDED BY HIS SON PEKAHIAH
JUDAH HAD TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF THE DISTURBED CONDITIONS IN ISRAEL TO ASSERT ITS INDEPENDENCE
HE CONDEMNED ISRAEL FOR ITS IDOLATRIES AND CRIED
FOR THUS SAITH THE LORD UNTO THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL SEEK YE ME AND YE SHALL LIVE HAVE YE OFFERED UNTO ME SACRIFICES AND OFFERINGS IN THE WILDERNESS FORTY YEARS O HOUSE OF ISRAEL
THE REMNANT OF THE PHILISTINES SHALL PERISH
ISRAEL WAS ALSO DEALT WITH
HE SWEPT THROUGH ISRAEL LIKE A HURRICANE
THE PHILISTINES AND THE ARABIANS OF THE DESERT WERE ALSO SUBDUED
HE INVADED BABYLONIA
UKINZER TOOK REFUGE IN HIS CAPITAL SHAPIA WHICH HELD OUT SUCCESSFULLY ALTHOUGH THE SURROUNDING COUNTRY WAS RAVAGED AND DESPOILED
WOULD IT WOULD LEAVE ME AND THEN I COULD BELIEVE I SHALL NOT ALWAYS HAVE OCCASION FOR IT
MY POOR LADY VAVASOUR IS CARRIED TO THE TOWER AND HER GREAT BELLY COULD NOT EXCUSE HER BECAUSE SHE WAS ACQUAINTED BY SOMEBODY THAT THERE WAS A PLOT AGAINST THE PROTECTOR AND DID NOT DISCOVER IT
SHE HAS TOLD NOW ALL THAT WAS TOLD HER BUT VOWS SHE WILL NEVER SAY FROM WHENCE SHE HAD IT WE SHALL SEE WHETHER HER RESOLUTIONS ARE AS UNALTERABLE AS THOSE OF MY LADY TALMASH
I WONDER HOW SHE BEHAVED HERSELF WHEN SHE WAS MARRIED
I NEVER SAW ANY ONE YET THAT DID NOT LOOK SIMPLY AND OUT OF COUNTENANCE NOR EVER KNEW A WEDDING WELL DESIGNED BUT ONE AND THAT WAS OF TWO PERSONS WHO HAD TIME ENOUGH I CONFESS TO CONTRIVE IT AND NOBODY TO PLEASE IN'T BUT THEMSELVES
THE TRUTH IS I COULD NOT ENDURE TO BE MISSUS BRIDE IN A PUBLIC WEDDING TO BE MADE THE HAPPIEST PERSON ON EARTH
DO NOT TAKE IT ILL FOR I WOULD ENDURE IT IF I COULD RATHER THAN FAIL BUT IN EARNEST I DO NOT THINK IT WERE POSSIBLE FOR ME
YET IN EARNEST YOUR FATHER WILL NOT FIND MY BROTHER PEYTON WANTING IN CIVILITY THOUGH HE IS NOT A MAN OF MUCH COMPLIMENT UNLESS IT BE IN HIS LETTERS TO ME NOR AN UNREASONABLE PERSON IN ANYTHING SO HE WILL ALLOW HIM OUT OF HIS KINDNESS TO HIS WIFE TO SET A HIGHER VALUE UPON HER SISTER THAN SHE DESERVES
MY AUNT TOLD ME NO LONGER AGONE THAN YESTERDAY THAT I WAS THE MOST WILFUL WOMAN THAT EVER SHE KNEW AND HAD AN OBSTINACY OF SPIRIT NOTHING COULD OVERCOME TAKE HEED
YOU SEE I GIVE YOU FAIR WARNING
BY THE NEXT I SHALL BE GONE INTO KENT AND MY OTHER JOURNEY IS LAID ASIDE WHICH I AM NOT DISPLEASED AT BECAUSE IT WOULD HAVE BROKEN OUR INTERCOURSE VERY MUCH
HERE ARE SOME VERSES OF COWLEY'S TELL ME HOW YOU LIKE THEM
I TOLD YOU IN MY LAST THAT MY SUFFOLK JOURNEY WAS LAID ASIDE AND THAT INTO KENT HASTENED
IF I DROWN BY THE WAY THIS WILL BE MY LAST LETTER AND LIKE A WILL I BEQUEATH ALL MY KINDNESS TO YOU IN IT WITH A CHARGE NEVER TO BESTOW IT ALL UPON ANOTHER MISTRESS LEST MY GHOST RISE AGAIN AND HAUNT YOU
INDEED I LIKE HIM EXTREMELY AND HE IS COMMENDED TO ME BY PEOPLE THAT KNOW HIM VERY WELL AND ARE ABLE TO JUDGE FOR A MOST EXCELLENT SERVANT AND FAITHFUL AS POSSIBLE
BECAUSE YOU FIND FAULT WITH MY OTHER LETTERS THIS IS LIKE TO BE SHORTER THAN THEY I DID NOT INTEND IT SO THOUGH I CAN ASSURE YOU
I DO NOT FIND IT THOUGH I AM TOLD I WAS SO EXTREMELY WHEN I BELIEVED YOU LOVED ME
BUT I AM CALLED UPON
DIRECTED FOR YOUR MASTER
I SEE YOU CAN CHIDE WHEN YOU PLEASE AND WITH AUTHORITY BUT I DESERVE IT I CONFESS AND ALL I CAN SAY FOR MYSELF IS THAT MY FAULT PROCEEDED FROM A VERY GOOD PRINCIPLE IN ME
WE DARE NOT LET OUR TONGUES LIE MORE ON ONE SIDE OF OUR MOUTHS THAN T'OTHER FOR FEAR OF OVERTURNING IT
YOU ARE SATISFIED I HOPE ERE THIS THAT I SCAPED DROWNING
BUT I AM TROUBLED MUCH YOU SHOULD MAKE SO ILL A JOURNEY TO SO LITTLE PURPOSE INDEED I WRIT BY THE FIRST POST AFTER MY ARRIVAL HERE AND CANNOT IMAGINE HOW YOU CAME TO MISS OF MY LETTERS
HOW WELCOME YOU WILL BE BUT ALAS
FOR MY LIFE I CANNOT BEAT INTO THEIR HEADS A PASSION THAT MUST BE SUBJECT TO NO DECAY AN EVEN PERFECT KINDNESS THAT MUST LAST PERPETUALLY WITHOUT THE LEAST INTERMISSION
THEY LAUGH TO HEAR ME SAY THAT ONE UNKIND WORD WOULD DESTROY ALL THE SATISFACTION OF MY LIFE AND THAT I SHOULD EXPECT OUR KINDNESS SHOULD INCREASE EVERY DAY IF IT WERE POSSIBLE BUT NEVER LESSEN
WE GO ABROAD ALL DAY AND PLAY ALL NIGHT AND SAY OUR PRAYERS WHEN WE HAVE TIME
WELL IN SOBER EARNEST NOW I WOULD NOT LIVE THUS A TWELVEMONTH TO GAIN ALL THAT THE KING HAS LOST UNLESS IT WERE TO GIVE IT HIM AGAIN
WILL YOU BE SO GOOD NATURED
HE HAS ONE SON AND TIS THE FINEST BOY THAT E'ER YOU SAW AND HAS A NOBLE SPIRIT BUT YET STANDS IN THAT AWE OF HIS FATHER THAT ONE WORD FROM HIM IS AS MUCH AS TWENTY WHIPPINGS
YOU MUST GIVE ME LEAVE TO ENTERTAIN YOU THUS WITH DISCOURSES OF THE FAMILY FOR I CAN TELL YOU NOTHING ELSE FROM HENCE
NOT TO KNOW WHEN YOU WOULD COME HOME I CAN ASSURE YOU NOR FOR ANY OTHER OCCASION OF MY OWN BUT WITH A COUSIN OF MINE THAT HAD LONG DESIGNED TO MAKE HERSELF SPORT WITH HIM AND DID NOT MISS OF HER AIM
IN MY LIFE I NEVER HEARD SO RIDICULOUS A DISCOURSE AS HE MADE US AND NO OLD WOMAN WHO PASSES FOR A WITCH COULD HAVE BEEN MORE PUZZLED TO SEEK WHAT TO SAY TO REASONABLE PEOPLE THAN HE WAS
EVER SINCE THIS ADVENTURE I HAVE HAD SO GREAT A BELIEF IN ALL THINGS OF THIS NATURE THAT I COULD NOT FORBEAR LAYING A PEAS COD WITH NINE PEAS IN'T UNDER MY DOOR YESTERDAY AND WAS INFORMED BY IT THAT MY HUSBAND'S NAME SHOULD BE THOMAS HOW DO YOU LIKE THAT
BUT I AM HUGELY PLEASED THAT YOU HAVE SEEN MY LADY
I KNEW YOU COULD NOT CHOOSE BUT LIKE HER BUT YET LET ME TELL YOU YOU HAVE SEEN BUT THE WORST OF HER
HER CONVERSATION HAS MORE CHARMS THAN CAN BE IN MERE BEAUTY AND HER HUMOUR AND DISPOSITION WOULD MAKE A DEFORMED PERSON APPEAR LOVELY
WHY DID YOU NOT SEND ME THAT NEWS AND A GARLAND
WELL THE BEST ON'T IS I HAVE A SQUIRE NOW THAT IS AS GOOD AS A KNIGHT
IN EARNEST WE HAVE HAD SUCH A SKIRMISH AND UPON SO FOOLISH AN OCCASION AS I CANNOT TELL WHICH IS STRANGEST
ALL THE PEOPLE THAT I HAD EVER IN MY LIFE REFUSED WERE BROUGHT AGAIN UPON THE STAGE LIKE RICHARD THE THREE S GHOSTS TO REPROACH ME WITHAL AND ALL THE KINDNESS HIS DISCOVERIES COULD MAKE I HAD FOR YOU WAS LAID TO MY CHARGE
MY BEST QUALITIES IF I HAVE ANY THAT ARE GOOD SERVED BUT FOR AGGRAVATIONS OF MY FAULT AND I WAS ALLOWED TO HAVE WIT AND UNDERSTANDING AND DISCRETION IN OTHER THINGS THAT IT MIGHT APPEAR I HAD NONE IN THIS
TIS A STRANGE CHANGE AND I AM VERY SORRY FOR IT BUT I'LL SWEAR I KNOW NOT HOW TO HELP IT
MISTER FISH IS THE SQUIRE OF DAMES AND HAS SO MANY MISTRESSES THAT ANYBODY MAY PRETEND A SHARE IN HIM AND BE BELIEVED BUT THOUGH I HAVE THE HONOUR TO BE HIS NEAR NEIGHBOUR TO SPEAK FREELY I CANNOT BRAG MUCH THAT HE MAKES ANY COURT TO ME AND I KNOW NO YOUNG WOMAN IN THE COUNTRY THAT HE DOES NOT VISIT OFTEN
I THINK MY YOUNGEST BROTHER COMES DOWN WITH HIM
I CAN NO SOONER GIVE YOU SOME LITTLE HINTS WHEREABOUTS THEY LIVE BUT YOU KNOW THEM PRESENTLY AND I MEANT YOU SHOULD BE BEHOLDING TO ME FOR YOUR ACQUAINTANCE
BUT IT SEEMS THIS GENTLEMAN IS NOT SO EASY ACCESS BUT YOU MAY ACKNOWLEDGE SOMETHING DUE TO ME IF I INCLINE HIM TO LOOK GRACIOUSLY UPON YOU AND THEREFORE THERE IS NOT MUCH HARM DONE
I HAVE MISSED FOUR FITS AND HAD BUT FIVE AND HAVE RECOVERED SO MUCH STRENGTH AS MADE ME VENTURE TO MEET YOUR LETTER ON WEDNESDAY A MILE FROM HOME
BUT BESIDES I CAN GIVE YOU OTHERS
I AM HERE MUCH MORE OUT OF PEOPLE'S WAY THAN IN TOWN WHERE MY AUNT AND SUCH AS PRETEND AN INTEREST IN ME AND A POWER OVER ME DO SO PERSECUTE ME WITH THEIR GOOD NATURE AND TAKE IT SO ILL THAT THEY ARE NOT ACCEPTED AS I WOULD LIVE IN A HOLLOW TREE TO AVOID THEM
YOU WILL THINK HIM ALTERED AND IF IT BE POSSIBLE MORE MELANCHOLY THAN HE WAS
IF MARRIAGE AGREES NO BETTER WITH OTHER PEOPLE THAN IT DOES WITH HIM I SHALL PRAY THAT ALL MY FRIENDS MAY SCAPE IT
WELL IN EARNEST IF I WERE A PRINCE THAT LADY SHOULD BE MY MISTRESS BUT I CAN GIVE NO RULE TO ANY ONE ELSE AND PERHAPS THOSE THAT ARE IN NO DANGER OF LOSING THEIR HEARTS TO HER MAY BE INFINITELY TAKEN WITH ONE I SHOULD NOT VALUE AT ALL FOR SO SAYS THE JUSTINIAN WISE PROVIDENCE HAS ORDAINED IT THAT BY THEIR DIFFERENT HUMOURS EVERYBODY MIGHT FIND SOMETHING TO PLEASE THEMSELVES WITHAL WITHOUT ENVYING THEIR NEIGHBOURS
THE MATTER IS NOT GREAT FOR I CONFESS I DO NATURALLY HATE THE NOISE AND TALK OF THE WORLD AND SHOULD BE BEST PLEASED NEVER TO BE KNOWN IN'T UPON ANY OCCASION WHATSOEVER YET SINCE IT CAN NEVER BE WHOLLY AVOIDED ONE MUST SATISFY ONESELF BY DOING NOTHING THAT ONE NEED CARE WHO KNOWS
IF I HAD A PICTURE THAT WERE FIT FOR YOU YOU SHOULD HAVE IT
HOW CAN YOU TALK OF DEFYING FORTUNE NOBODY LIVES WITHOUT IT AND THEREFORE WHY SHOULD YOU IMAGINE YOU COULD
I KNOW NOT HOW MY BROTHER COMES TO BE SO WELL INFORMED AS YOU SAY BUT I AM CERTAIN HE KNOWS THE UTMOST OF THE INJURIES YOU HAVE RECEIVED FROM HER
WE HAVE HAD ANOTHER DEBATE BUT MUCH MORE CALMLY
AND BESIDES THERE WAS A TIME WHEN WE OURSELVES WERE INDIFFERENT TO ONE ANOTHER DID I DO SO THEN OR HAVE I LEARNED IT SINCE
I HAVE BEEN STUDYING HOW TOM CHEEKE MIGHT COME BY HIS INTELLIGENCE AND I VERILY BELIEVE HE HAS IT FROM MY COUSIN PETERS
HOW KINDLY DO I TAKE THESE CIVILITIES OF YOUR FATHER'S IN EARNEST YOU CANNOT IMAGINE HOW HIS LETTER PLEASED ME
OLD MISTER DINSMORE HAD ACCEPTED A PRESSING INVITATION FROM HIS GRANDDAUGHTER AND HER HUSBAND TO JOIN THE PARTY AND WITH THE ADDITION OF SERVANTS IT WAS A LARGE ONE
AS THEY WERE IN NO HASTE AND THE CONFINEMENT OF A RAILROAD CAR WOULD BE VERY IRKSOME TO THE YOUNGER CHILDREN IT HAD BEEN DECIDED TO MAKE THE JOURNEY BY WATER
THERE WERE NO SAD LEAVE TAKINGS TO MAR THEIR PLEASURE THE CHILDREN WERE IN WILD SPIRITS AND ALL SEEMED CHEERFUL AND HAPPY AS THEY SAT OR STOOD UPON THE DECK WATCHING THE RECEDING SHORE AS THE VESSEL STEAMED OUT OF THE HARBOR
AT LENGTH THE LAND HAD QUITE DISAPPEARED NOTHING COULD BE SEEN BUT THE SKY OVERHEAD AND A VAST EXPANSE OF WATER ALL AROUND AND THE PASSENGERS FOUND LEISURE TO TURN THEIR ATTENTION UPON EACH OTHER
THERE ARE SOME NICE LOOKING PEOPLE ON BOARD REMARKED MISTER TRAVILLA IN AN UNDERTONE TO HIS WIFE
BESIDE OURSELVES ADDED COUSIN RONALD LAUGHING
YES SHE ANSWERED THAT LITTLE GROUP YONDER A YOUNG MINISTER AND HIS WIFE AND CHILD I SUPPOSE
AND WHAT A DEAR LITTLE FELLOW HE IS JUST ABOUT THE AGE OF OUR HAROLD I SHOULD JUDGE
DO YOU SON WAS THE SMILING REJOINDER
HE CERTAINLY LOOKS LIKE A VERY NICE LITTLE BOY
SUPPOSE YOU AND HE SHAKE HANDS FRANK
I DO INDEED THOUGH PROBABLY COMPARATIVELY FEW ARE AWARE THAT TOBACCO IS THE CAUSE OF THEIR AILMENTS
DOUBTLESS THAT IS THE CASE REMARKED MISTER DINSMORE
WITH ALL MY HEART IF YOU WILL STEP INTO THE GENTLEMEN'S CABIN WHERE THERE'S A LIGHT
HE LED THE WAY THE OTHERS ALL FOLLOWING AND TAKING OUT A SLIP OF PAPER READ FROM IT IN A DISTINCT TONE LOUD ENOUGH TO BE HEARD BY THOSE ABOUT HIM WITHOUT DISTURBING THE OTHER PASSENGERS
ONE DROP OF NICOTINE EXTRACT OF TOBACCO PLACED ON THE TONGUE OF A DOG WILL KILL HIM IN A MINUTE THE HUNDREDTH PART OF A GRAIN PICKED UNDER THE SKIN OF A MAN'S ARM WILL PRODUCE NAUSEA AND FAINTING
THE HALF DOZEN CIGARS WHICH MOST SMOKERS USE A DAY CONTAIN SIX OR SEVEN GRAINS ENOUGH IF CONCENTRATED AND ABSORBED TO KILL THREE MEN AND A POUND OF TOBACCO ACCORDING TO ITS QUALITY CONTAINS FROM ONE QUARTER TO ONE AND A QUARTER OUNCES
IS IT STRANGE THEN THAT SMOKERS AND CHEWERS HAVE A THOUSAND AILMENTS
THAT THE FRENCH POLYTECHNIC INSTITUTE HAD TO PROHIBIT ITS USE ON ACCOUNT OF ITS EFFECTS ON THE MIND
NOTICE THE MULTITUDE OF SUDDEN DEATHS AND SEE HOW MANY ARE SMOKERS AND CHEWERS
IN A SMALL COUNTRY TOWN SEVEN OF THESE MYSTERIOUS PROVIDENCES OCCURRED WITHIN THE CIRCUIT OF A MILE ALL DIRECTLY TRACEABLE TO TOBACCO AND ANY PHYSICIAN ON A FEW MOMENTS REFLECTION CAN MATCH THIS FACT BY HIS OWN OBSERVATION
AND THEN SUCH POWERFUL ACIDS PRODUCE INTENSE IRRITATION AND THIRST THIRST WHICH WATER DOES NOT QUENCH
HENCE A RESORT TO CIDER AND BEER
NO SIR WHAT KNOW YE NOT THAT YOUR BODY IS THE TEMPLE OF THE HOLY GHOST WHICH IS IN YOU WHICH YE HAVE OF GOD AND YE ARE NOT YOUR OWN
FOR YE ARE BOUGHT WITH A PRICE THEREFORE GLORIFY GOD IN YOUR BODY AND IN YOUR SPIRIT WHICH ARE GOD'S
WE CERTAINLY HAVE NO RIGHT TO INJURE OUR BODIES EITHER BY NEGLECT OR SELF INDULGENCE
AND AGAIN I BESEECH YOU THEREFORE BRETHREN BY THE MERCIES OF GOD THAT YE PRESENT YOUR BODIES A LIVING SACRIFICE HOLY ACCEPTABLE UNTO GOD WHICH IS YOUR REASONABLE SERVICE
IT MUST REQUIRE A GOOD DEAL OF RESOLUTION FOR ONE WHO HAS BECOME FOND OF THE INDULGENCE TO GIVE IT UP REMARKED MISTER DALY
NO DOUBT NO DOUBT RETURNED MISTER LILBURN BUT IF THY RIGHT EYE OFFEND THEE PLUCK IT OUT AND CAST IT FROM THEE FOR IT IS PROFITABLE FOR THEE THAT ONE OF THY MEMBERS SHOULD PERISH AND NOT THAT THY WHOLE BODY SHOULD BE CAST INTO HELL
THERE WAS A PAUSE BROKEN BY YOUNG HORACE WHO HAD BEEN WATCHING A GROUP OF MEN GATHERED ABOUT A TABLE AT THE FURTHER END OF THE ROOM
THEY ARE GAMBLING YONDER AND I'M AFRAID THAT YOUNG FELLOW IS BEING BADLY FLEECED BY THAT MIDDLE AGED MAN OPPOSITE
THE EYES OF THE WHOLE PARTY WERE AT ONCE TURNED IN THAT DIRECTION
NO SIR HE IS NOT HERE
AND THE DOOR WAS SLAMMED VIOLENTLY TO
NOW THE VOICE CAME FROM THE SKYLIGHT OVERHEAD APPARENTLY AND WITH A FIERCE IMPRECATION THE IRATE GAMESTER RUSHED UPON DECK AND RAN HITHER AND THITHER IN SEARCH OF HIS TORMENTOR
HIS VICTIM WHO HAD BEEN LOOKING ON DURING THE LITTLE SCENE AND LISTENING TO THE MYSTERIOUS VOICE IN SILENT WIDE EYED WONDER AND FEAR NOW ROSE HASTILY HIS FACE DEATHLY PALE WITH TREMBLING HANDS GATHERED UP THE MONEY HE HAD STAKED AND HURRYING INTO HIS STATE ROOM LOCKED HIMSELF IN
WHAT DOES IT MEAN CRIED ONE
A VENTRILOQUIST ABOARD OF COURSE RETURNED ANOTHER LET'S FOLLOW AND SEE THE FUN
I WONDER WHICH OF US IT IS REMARKED THE FIRST LOOKING HARD AT OUR PARTY I DON'T KNOW BUT COME ON
THAT FELLOW NICK WARD IS A NOTED BLACKLEG AND RUFFIAN HAD HIS NOSE BROKEN IN A FIGHT AND IS SENSITIVE ON THE SUBJECT WAS CHEATING OF COURSE
WHO ASKED THE MATE I'VE SEEN NONE UP HERE THOUGH THERE ARE SOME IN THE STEERAGE
THEY HEARD HIM IN SILENCE WITH A COOL PHLEGMATIC INDIFFERENCE MOST EXASPERATING TO ONE IN HIS PRESENT MOOD
A MAN OF GIANT SIZE AND HERCULEAN STRENGTH HAD LAID ASIDE HIS PIPE AND SLOWLY RISING TO HIS FEET SEIZED THE SCOUNDREL IN HIS POWERFUL GRASP
LET ME GO YELLED WARD MAKING A DESPERATE EFFORT TO FREE HIS ARMS
I DINKS NO I DINKS I DEACH YOU VON LESSON RETURNED HIS CAPTOR NOT RELAXING HIS GRASP IN THE LEAST
THE GERMAN RELEASED HIS PRISONER AND THE LATTER SLUNK AWAY WITH MUTTERED THREATS AND IMPRECATIONS UPON THE HEAD OF HIS TORMENTOR
MISTER LILBURN AND MISTER DALY EACH AT A DIFFERENT TIME SOUGHT OUT THE YOUNG MAN WARD'S INTENDED VICTIM AND TRIED TO INFLUENCE HIM FOR GOOD
YET THERE WAS GAMBLING AGAIN THE SECOND NIGHT BETWEEN WARD AND SEVERAL OTHERS OF HIS PROFESSION
THEY KEPT IT UP TILL AFTER MIDNIGHT
THEN MISTER LILBURN WAKING FROM HIS FIRST SLEEP IN A STATEROOM NEAR BY THOUGHT HE WOULD BREAK IT UP ONCE MORE
AN INTENSE VOICELESS EXCITEMENT POSSESSED THE PLAYERS FOR THE GAME WAS A CLOSE ONE AND THE STAKES WERE VERY HEAVY
THEY BENT EAGERLY OVER THE BOARD EACH WATCHING WITH FEVERISH ANXIETY HIS COMPANION'S MOVEMENTS EACH CASTING NOW AND AGAIN A GLOATING EYE UPON THE HEAP OF GOLD AND GREENBACKS THAT LAY BETWEEN THEM AND AT TIMES HALF STRETCHING OUT HIS HAND TO CLUTCH IT
A DEEP GROAN STARTLED THEM AND THEY SPRANG TO THEIR FEET PALE AND TREMBLING WITH SUDDEN TERROR EACH HOLDING HIS BREATH AND STRAINING HIS EAR TO CATCH A REPETITION OF THE DREAD SOUND
BUT ALL WAS SILENT AND AFTER A MOMENT OF ANXIOUS WAITING THEY SAT DOWN TO THEIR GAME AGAIN TRYING TO CONCEAL AND SHAKE OFF THEIR FEARS WITH A FORCED UNNATURAL LAUGH
IT CAME FROM UNDER THE TABLE GASPED WARD LOOK WHAT'S THERE LOOK YOURSELF
WHAT CAN IT HAVE BEEN THEY ASKED EACH OTHER
OH NONSENSE WHAT FOOLS WE ARE
IT WAS THE LAST GAME OF CARDS FOR THAT TRIP
THE CAPTAIN COMING IN SHORTLY AFTER THE SUDDEN FLIGHT OF THE GAMBLERS TOOK CHARGE OF THE MONEY AND THE NEXT DAY RESTORED IT TO THE OWNERS
TO ELSIE'S OBSERVANT EYES IT PRESENTLY BECAME EVIDENT THAT THE DALYS WERE IN VERY STRAITENED CIRCUMSTANCES
OH HOW KIND HOW VERY KIND MISSUS DALY SAID WITH TEARS OF JOY AND GRATITUDE WE HAVE HARDLY KNOWN HOW WE SHOULD MEET THE MOST NECESSARY EXPENSES OF THIS TRIP BUT HAVE BEEN TRYING TO CAST OUR CARE UPON THE LORD ASKING HIM TO PROVIDE
AND HOW WONDERFULLY HE HAS ANSWERED OUR PETITIONS
ELSIE ANSWERED PRESSING HER HAND AFFECTIONATELY ART WE NOT SISTERS IN CHRIST
YE ARE ALL THE CHILDREN OF GOD BY FAITH IN CHRIST JESUS
YE ARE ALL ONE IN CHRIST JESUS
WE FEEL MY HUSBAND AND I THAT WE ARE ONLY THE STEWARDS OF HIS BOUNTY AND THAT BECAUSE HE HAS SAID INASMUCH AS YE HAVE DONE IT UNTO ONE OF THE LEAST OF THESE MY BRETHREN YE HAVE DONE IT UNTO ME IT IS THE GREATEST PRIVILEGE AND DELIGHT TO DO ANYTHING FOR HIS PEOPLE
AFTERWARD IT WAS SUPPOSED THAT HE WAS SATISFIED WITH THE BLOOD OF OXEN LAMBS AND DOVES AND THAT IN EXCHANGE FOR OR ON ACCOUNT OF THESE SACRIFICES THIS GOD GAVE RAIN SUNSHINE AND HARVEST
WHETHER HE WAS THE CREATOR OF YOURSELF AND MYSELF
WHETHER ANY PRAYER WAS EVER ANSWERED
WHY DID HE CREATE THE INTELLECTUALLY INFERIOR
WHY DID HE CREATE THE DEFORMED AND HELPLESS WHY DID HE CREATE THE CRIMINAL THE IDIOTIC THE INSANE
ARE THE FAILURES UNDER OBLIGATION TO THEIR CREATOR
IS HE RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL THE WARS THAT HAVE BEEN WAGED FOR ALL THE INNOCENT BLOOD THAT HAS BEEN SHED
IS HE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CENTURIES OF SLAVERY FOR THE BACKS THAT HAVE BEEN SCARRED WITH THE LASH FOR THE BABES THAT HAVE BEEN SOLD FROM THE BREASTS OF MOTHERS FOR THE FAMILIES THAT HAVE BEEN SEPARATED AND DESTROYED
IS THIS GOD RESPONSIBLE FOR RELIGIOUS PERSECUTION FOR THE INQUISITION FOR THE THUMB SCREW AND RACK AND FOR ALL THE INSTRUMENTS OF TORTURE
DID THIS GOD ALLOW THE CRUEL AND VILE TO DESTROY THE BRAVE AND VIRTUOUS
DID HE ALLOW TYRANTS TO SHED THE BLOOD OF PATRIOTS
CAN WE CONCEIVE OF A DEVIL BASE ENOUGH TO PREFER HIS ENEMIES TO HIS FRIENDS
HOW CAN WE ACCOUNT FOR THE WILD BEASTS THAT DEVOUR HUMAN BEINGS FOR THE FANGED SERPENTS WHOSE BITE IS DEATH
HOW CAN WE ACCOUNT FOR A WORLD WHERE LIFE FEEDS ON LIFE
DID INFINITE WISDOM INTENTIONALLY PRODUCE THE MICROSCOPIC BEASTS THAT FEED UPON THE OPTIC NERVE THINK OF BLINDING A MAN TO SATISFY THE APPETITE OF A MICROBE
FEAR BUILDS THE ALTAR AND OFFERS THE SACRIFICE
FEAR ERECTS THE CATHEDRAL AND BOWS THE HEAD OF MAN IN WORSHIP
LIPS RELIGIOUS AND FEARFUL TREMBLINGLY REPEAT THIS PASSAGE THOUGH HE SLAY ME YET WILL I TRUST HIM
CAN WE SAY THAT HE CARED FOR THE CHILDREN OF MEN
CAN WE SAY THAT HIS MERCY ENDURETH FOREVER
DO WE PROVE HIS GOODNESS BY SHOWING THAT HE HAS OPENED THE EARTH AND SWALLOWED THOUSANDS OF HIS HELPLESS CHILDREN OR THAT WITH THE VOLCANOES HE HAS OVERWHELMED THEM WITH RIVERS OF FIRE
WAS THERE GOODNESS WAS THERE WISDOM IN THIS
OUGHT THE SUPERIOR RACES TO THANK GOD THAT THEY ARE NOT THE INFERIOR
MOST PEOPLE CLING TO THE SUPERNATURAL
IF THEY GIVE UP ONE GOD THEY IMAGINE ANOTHER
WHAT IS THIS POWER
MAN ADVANCES AND NECESSARILY ADVANCES THROUGH EXPERIENCE
A MAN WISHING TO GO TO A CERTAIN PLACE COMES TO WHERE THE ROAD DIVIDES
HE HAS TRIED THAT ROAD AND KNOWS THAT IT IS THE WRONG ROAD
A CHILD CHARMED BY THE BEAUTY OF THE FLAME GRASPS IT WITH ITS DIMPLED HAND
THE POWER THAT WORKS FOR RIGHTEOUSNESS HAS TAUGHT THE CHILD A LESSON
IT IS A RESULT
IT IS INSISTED BY THESE THEOLOGIANS AND BY MANY OF THE SO CALLED PHILOSOPHERS THAT THIS MORAL SENSE THIS SENSE OF DUTY OF OBLIGATION WAS IMPORTED AND THAT CONSCIENCE IS AN EXOTIC
WE LIVE TOGETHER IN FAMILIES TRIBES AND NATIONS
THEY ARE PRAISED ADMIRED AND RESPECTED
THEY ARE REGARDED AS GOOD THAT IS TO SAY AS MORAL
THE MEMBERS WHO ADD TO THE MISERY OF THE FAMILY THE TRIBE OR THE NATION ARE CONSIDERED BAD MEMBERS
THE GREATEST OF HUMAN BEINGS HAS SAID CONSCIENCE IS BORN OF LOVE
AS PEOPLE ADVANCE THE REMOTE CONSEQUENCES ARE PERCEIVED
THE IMAGINATION IS CULTIVATED
A MAN PUTS HIMSELF IN THE PLACE OF ANOTHER
THE SENSE OF DUTY BECOMES STRONGER MORE IMPERATIVE
MAN JUDGES HIMSELF
IN ALL THIS THERE IS NOTHING SUPERNATURAL
MAN HAS DECEIVED HIMSELF
HAS CHRISTIANITY DONE GOOD
WHEN THE CHURCH HAD CONTROL WERE MEN MADE BETTER AND HAPPIER
WHAT HAS RELIGION DONE FOR HUNGARY OR AUSTRIA
COULD THESE COUNTRIES HAVE BEEN WORSE WITHOUT RELIGION
COULD THEY HAVE BEEN WORSE HAD THEY HAD ANY OTHER RELIGION THAN CHRISTIANITY
WHAT DID CHRISTIANITY DO FOR THEM
THEY HATED PLEASURE
THEY MUFFLED ALL THE BELLS OF GLADNESS
THE RELIGION OF THE PURITAN WAS AN UNADULTERATED CURSE
THE PURITAN BELIEVED THE BIBLE TO BE THE WORD OF GOD AND THIS BELIEF HAS ALWAYS MADE THOSE WHO HELD IT CRUEL AND WRETCHED
LET ME REFER TO JUST ONE FACT SHOWING THE INFLUENCE OF A BELIEF IN THE BIBLE ON HUMAN BEINGS
THE QUEEN RECEIVED THE BIBLE KISSED IT AND PLEDGED HERSELF TO DILIGENTLY READ THEREIN
IN OTHER WORDS IT WAS JUST AS FIENDISH JUST AS INFAMOUS AS THE CATHOLIC SPIRIT
HAS THE BIBLE MADE THE PEOPLE OF GEORGIA KIND AND MERCIFUL
RELIGION HAS BEEN TRIED AND IN ALL COUNTRIES IN ALL TIMES HAS FAILED
RELIGION HAS ALWAYS BEEN THE ENEMY OF SCIENCE OF INVESTIGATION AND THOUGHT
RELIGION HAS NEVER MADE MAN FREE
IT HAS NEVER MADE MAN MORAL TEMPERATE INDUSTRIOUS AND HONEST
ARE CHRISTIANS MORE TEMPERATE NEARER VIRTUOUS NEARER HONEST THAN SAVAGES
CAN WE CURE DISEASE BY SUPPLICATION
CAN WE RECEIVE VIRTUE OR HONOR AS ALMS
RELIGION RESTS ON THE IDEA THAT NATURE HAS A MASTER AND THAT THIS MASTER WILL LISTEN TO PRAYER THAT THIS MASTER PUNISHES AND REWARDS THAT HE LOVES PRAISE AND FLATTERY AND HATES THE BRAVE AND FREE
WE MUST HAVE CORNER STONES
THE STRUCTURE MUST HAVE A BASEMENT
IF WE BUILD WE MUST BEGIN AT THE BOTTOM
I HAVE A THEORY AND I HAVE FOUR CORNER STONES
THE FIRST STONE IS THAT MATTER SUBSTANCE CANNOT BE DESTROYED CANNOT BE ANNIHILATED
IF THESE CORNER STONES ARE FACTS IT FOLLOWS AS A NECESSITY THAT MATTER AND FORCE ARE FROM AND TO ETERNITY THAT THEY CAN NEITHER BE INCREASED NOR DIMINISHED
IT FOLLOWS THAT NOTHING HAS BEEN OR CAN BE CREATED THAT THERE NEVER HAS BEEN OR CAN BE A CREATOR
IT FOLLOWS THAT THERE COULD NOT HAVE BEEN ANY INTELLIGENCE ANY DESIGN BACK OF MATTER AND FORCE
I SAY WHAT I THINK
EVERY EVENT HAS PARENTS
THAT WHICH HAS NOT HAPPENED COULD NOT
IN THE INFINITE CHAIN THERE IS AND THERE CAN BE NO BROKEN NO MISSING LINK
WE NOW KNOW THAT OUR FIRST PARENTS WERE NOT FOREIGNERS
WE NOW KNOW IF WE KNOW ANYTHING THAT THE UNIVERSE IS NATURAL AND THAT MEN AND WOMEN HAVE BEEN NATURALLY PRODUCED
WE KNOW THE PATHS THAT LIFE HAS TRAVELED
WE KNOW THE FOOTSTEPS OF ADVANCE THEY HAVE BEEN TRACED
FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS MEN AND WOMEN HAVE BEEN TRYING TO REFORM THE WORLD
WHY HAVE THE REFORMERS FAILED
THEY DEPEND ON THE LORD ON LUCK AND CHARITY
THEY LIVE BY FRAUD AND VIOLENCE AND BEQUEATH THEIR VICES TO THEIR CHILDREN
FAILURE SEEMS TO BE THE TRADEMARK OF NATURE WHY
NATURE PRODUCES WITHOUT PURPOSE SUSTAINS WITHOUT INTENTION AND DESTROYS WITHOUT THOUGHT
MUST THE WORLD FOREVER REMAIN THE VICTIM OF IGNORANT PASSION
WHY SHOULD MEN AND WOMEN HAVE CHILDREN THAT THEY CANNOT TAKE CARE OF CHILDREN THAT ARE BURDENS AND CURSES WHY
PASSION IS AND ALWAYS HAS BEEN DEAF
LAW CAN PUNISH BUT IT CAN NEITHER REFORM CRIMINALS NOR PREVENT CRIME
THIS CANNOT BE DONE BY TALK OR EXAMPLE
THIS IS THE SOLUTION OF THE WHOLE QUESTION
THIS FREES WOMAN
POVERTY AND CRIME WILL BE CHILDLESS
IT IS FAR BETTER TO BE FREE TO LEAVE THE FORTS AND BARRICADES OF FEAR TO STAND ERECT AND FACE THE FUTURE WITH A SMILE
THE GENTLEMAN HAD NOT EVEN NEEDED TO SIT DOWN TO BECOME INTERESTED APPARENTLY HE HAD TAKEN UP THE VOLUME FROM A TABLE AS SOON AS HE CAME IN AND STANDING THERE AFTER A SINGLE GLANCE ROUND THE APARTMENT HAD LOST HIMSELF IN ITS PAGES
THAT HAS AN UNFLATTERING SOUND FOR ME SAID THE YOUNG MAN
SHE IS WILLING TO RISK THAT
JUST AS I AM THE VISITOR INQUIRED PRESENTING HIMSELF WITH RATHER A WORK A DAY ASPECT
HE WAS TALL AND LEAN AND DRESSED THROUGHOUT IN BLACK HIS SHIRT COLLAR WAS LOW AND WIDE AND THE TRIANGLE OF LINEN A LITTLE CRUMPLED EXHIBITED BY THE OPENING OF HIS WAISTCOAT WAS ADORNED BY A PIN CONTAINING A SMALL RED STONE
IN SPITE OF THIS DECORATION THE YOUNG MAN LOOKED POOR AS POOR AS A YOUNG MAN COULD LOOK WHO HAD SUCH A FINE HEAD AND SUCH MAGNIFICENT EYES
THOSE OF BASIL RANSOM WERE DARK DEEP AND GLOWING HIS HEAD HAD A CHARACTER OF ELEVATION WHICH FAIRLY ADDED TO HIS STATURE IT WAS A HEAD TO BE SEEN ABOVE THE LEVEL OF A CROWD ON SOME JUDICIAL BENCH OR POLITICAL PLATFORM OR EVEN ON A BRONZE MEDAL
THESE THINGS THE EYES ESPECIALLY WITH THEIR SMOULDERING FIRE MIGHT HAVE INDICATED THAT HE WAS TO BE A GREAT AMERICAN STATESMAN OR ON THE OTHER HAND THEY MIGHT SIMPLY HAVE PROVED THAT HE CAME FROM CAROLINA OR ALABAMA
AND YET THE READER WHO LIKES A COMPLETE IMAGE WHO DESIRES TO READ WITH THE SENSES AS WELL AS WITH THE REASON IS ENTREATED NOT TO FORGET THAT HE PROLONGED HIS CONSONANTS AND SWALLOWED HIS VOWELS THAT HE WAS GUILTY OF ELISIONS AND INTERPOLATIONS WHICH WERE EQUALLY UNEXPECTED AND THAT HIS DISCOURSE WAS PERVADED BY SOMETHING SULTRY AND VAST SOMETHING ALMOST AFRICAN IN ITS RICH BASKING TONE SOMETHING THAT SUGGESTED THE TEEMING EXPANSE OF THE COTTON FIELD
AND HE TOOK UP HIS HAT VAGUELY A SOFT BLACK HAT WITH A LOW CROWN AND AN IMMENSE STRAIGHT BRIM
WELL SO IT IS THEY ARE ALL WITCHES AND WIZARDS MEDIUMS AND SPIRIT RAPPERS AND ROARING RADICALS
IF YOU ARE GOING TO DINE WITH HER YOU HAD BETTER KNOW IT OH MURDER
HE LOOKED AT MISSUS LUNA WITH INTELLIGENT INCREDULITY
SHE WAS ATTRACTIVE AND IMPERTINENT ESPECIALLY THE LATTER
HAVE YOU BEEN IN EUROPE
NO I HAVEN'T BEEN ANYWHERE
SHE HATES IT SHE WOULD LIKE TO ABOLISH IT
THIS LAST REMARK HE MADE AT A VENTURE FOR HE HAD NATURALLY NOT DEVOTED ANY SUPPOSITION WHATEVER TO MISSUS LUNA
ARE YOU VERY AMBITIOUS YOU LOOK AS IF YOU WERE
AND MISSUS LUNA ADDED THAT NOW SHE WAS BACK SHE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT SHE SHOULD DO
ONE DIDN'T EVEN KNOW WHAT ONE HAD COME BACK FOR
BESIDES OLIVE DIDN'T WANT HER IN BOSTON AND DIDN'T GO THROUGH THE FORM OF SAYING SO
THAT WAS ONE COMFORT WITH OLIVE SHE NEVER WENT THROUGH ANY FORMS
SHE STOOD THERE LOOKING CONSCIOUSLY AND RATHER SERIOUSLY AT MISTER RANSOM A SMILE OF EXCEEDING FAINTNESS PLAYED ABOUT HER LIPS IT WAS JUST PERCEPTIBLE ENOUGH TO LIGHT UP THE NATIVE GRAVITY OF HER FACE
HER VOICE WAS LOW AND AGREEABLE A CULTIVATED VOICE AND SHE EXTENDED A SLENDER WHITE HAND TO HER VISITOR WHO REMARKED WITH SOME SOLEMNITY HE FELT A CERTAIN GUILT OF PARTICIPATION IN MISSUS LUNA'S INDISCRETION THAT HE WAS INTENSELY HAPPY TO MAKE HER ACQUAINTANCE
HE OBSERVED THAT MISS CHANCELLOR'S HAND WAS AT ONCE COLD AND LIMP SHE MERELY PLACED IT IN HIS WITHOUT EXERTING THE SMALLEST PRESSURE
I SHALL BE BACK VERY LATE WE ARE GOING TO A THEATRE PARTY THAT'S WHY WE DINE SO EARLY
MISSUS LUNA'S FAMILIARITY EXTENDED EVEN TO HER SISTER SHE REMARKED TO MISS CHANCELLOR THAT SHE LOOKED AS IF SHE WERE GOT UP FOR A SEA VOYAGE
MISS CHANCELLOR HERSELF HAD THOUGHT SO MUCH ON THE VITAL SUBJECT WOULD NOT SHE MAKE A FEW REMARKS AND GIVE THEM SOME OF HER EXPERIENCES
HOW DID THE LADIES ON BEACON STREET FEEL ABOUT THE BALLOT
PERHAPS SHE COULD SPEAK FOR THEM MORE THAN FOR SOME OTHERS
WITH HER IMMENSE SYMPATHY FOR REFORM SHE FOUND HERSELF SO OFTEN WISHING THAT REFORMERS WERE A LITTLE DIFFERENT
OLIVE HATED TO HEAR THAT FINE AVENUE TALKED ABOUT AS IF IT WERE SUCH A REMARKABLE PLACE AND TO LIVE THERE WERE A PROOF OF WORLDLY GLORY
ALL SORTS OF INFERIOR PEOPLE LIVED THERE AND SO BRILLIANT A WOMAN AS MISSUS FARRINDER WHO LIVED AT ROXBURY OUGHT NOT TO MIX THINGS UP
SHE KNEW HER PLACE IN THE BOSTON HIERARCHY AND IT WAS NOT WHAT MISSUS FARRINDER SUPPOSED SO THAT THERE WAS A WANT OF PERSPECTIVE IN TALKING TO HER AS IF SHE HAD BEEN A REPRESENTATIVE OF THE ARISTOCRACY
SHE WISHED TO WORK IN ANOTHER FIELD SHE HAD LONG BEEN PREOCCUPIED WITH THE ROMANCE OF THE PEOPLE
THIS MIGHT SEEM ONE OF THE MOST ACCESSIBLE OF PLEASURES BUT IN POINT OF FACT SHE HAD NOT FOUND IT SO
CHARLIE WAS A YOUNG MAN IN A WHITE OVERCOAT AND A PAPER COLLAR IT WAS FOR HIM IN THE LAST ANALYSIS THAT THEY CARED MUCH THE MOST
OLIVE CHANCELLOR WONDERED HOW MISSUS FARRINDER WOULD TREAT THAT BRANCH OF THE QUESTION
IF IT BE NECESSARY WE ARE PREPARED TO TAKE CERTAIN STEPS TO CONCILIATE THE SHRINKING
OUR MOVEMENT IS FOR ALL IT APPEALS TO THE MOST DELICATE LADIES
RAISE THE STANDARD AMONG THEM AND BRING ME A THOUSAND NAMES
I LOOK AFTER THE DETAILS AS WELL AS THE BIG CURRENTS MISSUS FARRINDER ADDED IN A TONE AS EXPLANATORY AS COULD BE EXPECTED OF SUCH A WOMAN AND WITH A SMILE OF WHICH THE SWEETNESS WAS THRILLING TO HER LISTENER
SAID OLIVE CHANCELLOR WITH A FACE WHICH SEEMED TO PLEAD FOR A REMISSION OF RESPONSIBILITY
I WANT TO BE NEAR TO THEM TO HELP THEM
IT WAS ONE THING TO CHOOSE FOR HERSELF BUT NOW THE GREAT REPRESENTATIVE OF THE ENFRANCHISEMENT OF THEIR SEX FROM EVERY FORM OF BONDAGE HAD CHOSEN FOR HER
THE UNHAPPINESS OF WOMEN
THEY WERE HER SISTERS THEY WERE HER OWN AND THE DAY OF THEIR DELIVERY HAD DAWNED
THIS WAS THE ONLY SACRED CAUSE THIS WAS THE GREAT THE JUST REVOLUTION IT MUST TRIUMPH IT MUST SWEEP EVERYTHING BEFORE IT IT MUST EXACT FROM THE OTHER THE BRUTAL BLOOD STAINED RAVENING RACE THE LAST PARTICLE OF EXPIATION
THEY WOULD BE NAMES OF WOMEN WEAK INSULTED PERSECUTED BUT DEVOTED IN EVERY PULSE OF THEIR BEING TO THE CAUSE AND ASKING NO BETTER FATE THAN TO DIE FOR IT
IT WAS NOT CLEAR TO THIS INTERESTING GIRL IN WHAT MANNER SUCH A SACRIFICE AS THIS LAST WOULD BE REQUIRED OF HER BUT SHE SAW THE MATTER THROUGH A KIND OF SUNRISE MIST OF EMOTION WHICH MADE DANGER AS ROSY AS SUCCESS
WHEN MISS BIRDSEYE APPROACHED IT TRANSFIGURED HER FAMILIAR HER COMICAL SHAPE AND MADE THE POOR LITTLE HUMANITARY HACK SEEM ALREADY A MARTYR
OLIVE CHANCELLOR LOOKED AT HER WITH LOVE REMEMBERED THAT SHE HAD NEVER IN HER LONG UNREWARDED WEARY LIFE HAD A THOUGHT OR AN IMPULSE FOR HERSELF
SHE HAD BEEN CONSUMED BY THE PASSION OF SYMPATHY IT HAD CRUMPLED HER INTO AS MANY CREASES AS AN OLD GLAZED DISTENDED GLOVE
POOR RANSOM ANNOUNCED THIS FACT TO HIMSELF AS IF HE HAD MADE A GREAT DISCOVERY BUT IN REALITY HE HAD NEVER BEEN SO BOEOTIAN AS AT THAT MOMENT
THE WOMEN HE HAD HITHERTO KNOWN HAD BEEN MAINLY OF HIS OWN SOFT CLIME AND IT WAS NOT OFTEN THEY EXHIBITED THE TENDENCY HE DETECTED AND CURSORILY DEPLORED IN MISSUS LUNA'S SISTER
RANSOM WAS PLEASED WITH THE VISION OF THAT REMEDY IT MUST BE REPEATED THAT HE WAS VERY PROVINCIAL
HE WAS SORRY FOR HER BUT HE SAW IN A FLASH THAT NO ONE COULD HELP HER THAT WAS WHAT MADE HER TRAGIC
SHE COULD NOT DEFEND HERSELF AGAINST A RICH ADMIRATION A KIND OF TENDERNESS OF ENVY OF ANY ONE WHO HAD BEEN SO HAPPY AS TO HAVE THAT OPPORTUNITY
HIS FAMILY WAS RUINED THEY HAD LOST THEIR SLAVES THEIR PROPERTY THEIR FRIENDS AND RELATIONS THEIR HOME HAD TASTED OF ALL THE CRUELTY OF DEFEAT
THE STATE OF MISSISSIPPI SEEMED TO HIM THE STATE OF DESPAIR SO HE SURRENDERED THE REMNANTS OF HIS PATRIMONY TO HIS MOTHER AND SISTERS AND AT NEARLY THIRTY YEARS OF AGE ALIGHTED FOR THE FIRST TIME IN NEW YORK IN THE COSTUME OF HIS PROVINCE WITH FIFTY DOLLARS IN HIS POCKET AND A GNAWING HUNGER IN HIS HEART
IT WAS IN THE FEMALE LINE AS BASIL RANSOM HAD WRITTEN IN ANSWERING HER LETTER WITH A GOOD DEAL OF FORM AND FLOURISH HE SPOKE AS IF THEY HAD BEEN ROYAL HOUSES
IF IT HAD BEEN POSSIBLE TO SEND MISSUS RANSOM MONEY OR EVEN CLOTHES SHE WOULD HAVE LIKED THAT BUT SHE HAD NO MEANS OF ASCERTAINING HOW SUCH AN OFFERING WOULD BE TAKEN
OLIVE HAD A FEAR OF EVERYTHING BUT HER GREATEST FEAR WAS OF BEING AFRAID
SHE HAD ERECTED IT INTO A SORT OF RULE OF CONDUCT THAT WHENEVER SHE SAW A RISK SHE WAS TO TAKE IT AND SHE HAD FREQUENT HUMILIATIONS AT FINDING HERSELF SAFE AFTER ALL
SHE WAS PERFECTLY SAFE AFTER WRITING TO BASIL RANSOM AND INDEED IT WAS DIFFICULT TO SEE WHAT HE COULD HAVE DONE TO HER EXCEPT THANK HER HE WAS ONLY EXCEPTIONALLY SUPERLATIVE FOR HER LETTER AND ASSURE HER THAT HE WOULD COME AND SEE HER THE FIRST TIME HIS BUSINESS HE WAS BEGINNING TO GET A LITTLE SHOULD TAKE HIM TO BOSTON
HE WAS TOO SIMPLE TOO MISSISSIPPIAN FOR THAT SHE WAS ALMOST DISAPPOINTED
OF ALL THINGS IN THE WORLD CONTENTION WAS MOST SWEET TO HER THOUGH WHY IT IS HARD TO IMAGINE FOR IT ALWAYS COST HER TEARS HEADACHES A DAY OR TWO IN BED ACUTE EMOTION AND IT WAS VERY POSSIBLE BASIL RANSOM WOULD NOT CARE TO CONTEND
WHEN HE CAME FROM THE BATH PROCLUS VISITED HIM AGAIN
BUT HERMON WAS NOT IN THE MOOD TO SHARE A JOYOUS REVEL AND HE FRANKLY SAID SO ALTHOUGH IMMEDIATELY AFTER HIS RETURN HE HAD ACCEPTED THE INVITATION TO THE FESTIVAL WHICH THE WHOLE FELLOWSHIP OF ARTISTS WOULD GIVE THE FOLLOWING DAY IN HONOUR OF THE SEVENTIETH BIRTHDAY OF THE OLD SCULPTOR EUPHRANOR
SHE WOULD APPEAR HERSELF AT DESSERT AND THE BANQUET MUST THEREFORE BEGIN AT AN UNUSUALLY EARLY HOUR
SO THE ARTIST FOUND HIMSELF OBLIGED TO RELINQUISH HIS OPPOSITION
THE BANQUET WAS TO BEGIN IN A FEW HOURS YET HE COULD NOT LET THE DAY PASS WITHOUT SEEING DAPHNE AND TELLING HER THE WORDS OF THE ORACLE
HE LONGED WITH ARDENT YEARNING FOR THE SOUND OF HER VOICE AND STILL MORE TO UNBURDEN HIS SORELY TROUBLED SOUL TO HER
SINCE HIS RETURN FROM THE ORACLE THE FEAR THAT THE RESCUED DEMETER MIGHT YET BE THE WORK OF MYRTILUS HAD AGAIN MASTERED HIM
THE APPROVAL AS WELL AS THE DOUBTS WHICH IT AROUSED IN OTHERS STRENGTHENED HIS OPINION ALTHOUGH EVEN NOW HE COULD NOT SUCCEED IN BRINGING IT INTO HARMONY WITH THE FACTS
THEN HE WENT DIRECTLY TO THE NEIGHBOURING PALACE THE QUEEN MIGHT HAVE APPEARED ALREADY AND IT WOULD NOT DO TO KEEP HER WAITING
HITHERTO THE MERCHANT HAD BEEN INDUCED IT IS TRUE TO ADVANCE LARGE SUMS OF MONEY TO THE QUEEN BUT THE LOYAL DEVOTION WHICH HE SHOWED TO HER ROYAL HUSBAND HAD RENDERED IT IMPOSSIBLE TO GIVE HIM EVEN A HINT OF THE CONSPIRACY
WHEN HERMON ENTERED THE RESIDENCE OF THE GRAMMATEUS IN THE PALACE THE GUESTS HAD ALREADY ASSEMBLED
THE PLACE BY HERMON'S SIDE WHICH ALTHEA HAD CHOSEN FOR HERSELF WOULD THEN BE GIVEN UP TO ARSINOE
TRUE AN INTERESTING CONVERSATION STILL HAD POWER TO CHARM HIM BUT OFTEN DURING ITS CONTINUANCE THE FULL CONSCIOUSNESS OF HIS MISFORTUNE FORCED ITSELF UPON HIS MIND FOR THE MAJORITY OF THE SUBJECTS DISCUSSED BY THE ARTISTS CAME TO THEM THROUGH THE MEDIUM OF SIGHT AND REFERRED TO NEW CREATIONS OF ARCHITECTURE SCULPTURE AND PAINTING FROM WHOSE ENJOYMENT HIS BLINDNESS DEBARRED HIM
A STRANGER OUT OF HIS OWN SPHERE HE FELT CHILLED AMONG THESE CLOSELY UNITED MEN AND WOMEN TO WHOM NO TIE BOUND HIM SAVE THE PRESENCE OF THE SAME HOST
CRATES HAD REALLY BEEN INVITED IN ORDER TO WIN HIM OVER TO THE QUEEN'S CAUSE BUT CHARMING FAIR HAIRED NICO HAD BEEN COMMISSIONED BY THE CONSPIRATORS TO PERSUADE HIM TO SING ARSINOE'S PRAISES AMONG HIS PROFESSIONAL ASSOCIATES
HIS SON HAD BEEN THIS ROYAL DAME'S FIRST HUSBAND AND SHE HAD DESERTED HIM TO MARRY LYSIMACHUS THE AGED KING OF THRACE
THE KING'S SISTER THE OBJECT OF HIS LOVE CRIED HERMON INCREDULOUSLY
WE WOMEN ARE ONLY AS OLD AS WE LOOK AND THE LEECHES AND TIRING WOMEN OF THIS BEAUTY OF FORTY PRACTISE ARTS WHICH GIVE HER THE APPEARANCE OF TWENTY FIVE YET PERHAPS THE KING VALUES HER INTELLECT MORE THAN HER PERSON AND THE WISDOM OF A HUNDRED SERPENTS IS CERTAINLY UNITED IN THIS WOMAN'S HEAD
THE THREE MOST TRUSTWORTHY ONES ARE HERE AMYNTAS THE LEECH CHRYSIPPUS AND THE ADMIRABLE PROCLUS
LET US HOPE THAT YOU WILL MAKE THIS THREE LEAVED CLOVER THE LUCK PROMISING FOUR LEAVED ONE
YOUR UNCLE TOO HAS OFTEN WITH PRAISEWORTHY GENEROSITY HELPED ARSINOE IN MANY AN EMBARRASSMENT
HOW LONG HE KEPT YOU WAITING FOR THE FIRST WORD CONCERNING A WORK WHICH JUSTLY TRANSPORTED THE WHOLE CITY WITH DELIGHT
WHEN HE DID FINALLY SUMMON YOU HE SAID THINGS WHICH MUST HAVE WOUNDED YOU
THAT IS GOING TOO FAR REPLIED HERMON
HE WINKED AT HER AND MADE A SIGNIFICANT GESTURE AS HE SPOKE AND THEN INFORMED THE BLIND ARTIST HOW GRACIOUSLY ARSINOE HAD REMEMBERED HIM WHEN SHE HEARD OF THE REMEDY BY WHOSE AID MANY A WONDERFUL CURE OF BLIND EYES HAD BEEN MADE IN RHODES
THE ROYAL LADY HAD INQUIRED ABOUT HIM AND HIS SUFFERINGS WITH ALMOST SISTERLY INTEREST AND ALTHEA EAGERLY CONFIRMED THE STATEMENT
HERMON LISTENED TO THE PAIR IN SILENCE
THE RHODIAN WAS JUST BEGINNING TO PRAISE ARSINOE ALSO AS A SPECIAL FRIEND AND CONNOISSEUR OF THE SCULPTOR'S ART WHEN CRATES HERMON'S FELLOW STUDENT ASKED THE BLIND ARTIST IN BEHALF OF HIS BEAUTIFUL COMPANION WHY HIS DEMETER WAS PLACED UPON A PEDESTAL WHICH TO OTHERS AS WELL AS HIMSELF SEEMED TOO HIGH FOR THE SIZE OF THE STATUE
YET WHAT MATTERED IT EVEN IF THESE MISERABLE PEOPLE CONSIDERED THEMSELVES DECEIVED AND POINTED THE FINGER OF SCORN AT HIM
A WOMAN WHO YEARNS FOR THE REGARD OF ALL MEN AND MAKES LOVE A TOY EASILY LESSENS THE DEMANDS SHE IMPOSES UPON INDIVIDUALS
ONLY EVEN THOUGH LOVE HAS WHOLLY DISAPPEARED SHE STILL CLAIMS CONSIDERATION AND ALTHEA DID NOT WISH TO LOSE HERMON'S REGARD
HOW INDIFFERENT YOU LOOK BUT I TELL YOU HER DEEP BLUE EYES FLASHED AS SHE SPOKE THAT SO LONG AS YOU WERE STILL A GENUINE CREATING ARTIST THE CASE WAS DIFFERENT
THOUGH SO LOUD A DENIAL IS WRITTEN ON YOUR FACE I PERSIST IN MY CONVICTION AND THAT NO IDLE DELUSION ENSNARES ME I CAN PROVE
IT WAS NAY IT COULD HAVE BEEN NOTHING ELSE THAT VERY SPIDER
NOT A SOUND IF YOU VALUE YOUR LIVES
TO OFFER RESISTANCE WOULD HAVE BEEN MADNESS FOR EVEN HERMON PERCEIVED BY THE LOUD CLANKING OF WEAPONS AROUND THEM THE GREATLY SUPERIOR POWER OF THE ENEMY AND THEY WERE ACTING BY THE ORDERS OF THE KING TO THE PRISON NEAR THE PLACE OF EXECUTION
WAS HE TO BE LED TO THE EXECUTIONER'S BLOCK
WHAT PLEASURE HAD LIFE TO OFFER HIM THE BLIND MAN WHO WAS ALREADY DEAD TO HIS ART
OUGHT HE NOT TO GREET THIS SUDDEN END AS A BOON FROM THE IMMORTALS
DID IT NOT SPARE HIM A HUMILIATION AS GREAT AND PAINFUL AS COULD BE IMAGINED
WHATEVER MIGHT AWAIT HIM HE DESIRED NO BETTER FATE
IF HE HAD PASSED INTO ANNIHILATION HE HERMON WISHED TO FOLLOW HIM THITHER AND ANNIHILATION CERTAINLY MEANT REDEMPTION FROM PAIN AND MISERY
BUT IF HE WERE DESTINED TO MEET HIS MYRTILUS AND HIS MOTHER IN THE WORLD BEYOND THE GRAVE WHAT HAD HE NOT TO TELL THEM HOW SURE HE WAS OF FINDING A JOYFUL RECEPTION THERE FROM BOTH
THE POWER WHICH DELIVERED HIM OVER TO DEATH JUST AT THAT MOMENT WAS NOT NEMESIS NO IT WAS A KINDLY DEITY
YET IT WAS NO ILLUSION THAT DECEIVED HIM
AGAIN HE HEARD THE BELOVED VOICE AND THIS TIME IT ADDRESSED NOT ONLY HIM BUT WITH THE UTMOST HASTE THE COMMANDER OF THE SOLDIERS
SOMETIMES WITH TOUCHING ENTREATY SOMETIMES WITH IMPERIOUS COMMAND SHE PROTESTED AFTER GIVING HIM HER NAME THAT THIS MATTER COULD BE NOTHING BUT AN UNFORTUNATE MISTAKE
LASTLY WITH EARNEST WARMTH SHE BESOUGHT HIM BEFORE TAKING THE PRISONERS AWAY TO PERMIT HER TO SPEAK TO THE COMMANDING GENERAL PHILIPPUS HER FATHER'S GUEST WHO SHE WAS CERTAIN WAS IN THE PALACE
CRIED HERMON IN GRATEFUL AGITATION BUT SHE WOULD NOT LISTEN TO HIM AND FOLLOWED THE SOLDIER WHOM THE CAPTAIN DETAILED TO GUIDE HER INTO THE PALACE
TO MORROW YOU SHALL CONFESS TO ME WHO TREACHEROUSLY DIRECTED YOU TO THIS DANGEROUS PATH
DAPHNE AGAIN PLEADED FOR THE LIBERATION OF THE PRISONERS BUT PHILIPPUS SILENCED HER WITH THE GRAVE EXCLAMATION THE ORDER OF THE KING
AS SOON AS THE CAPTIVE ARTIST WAS ALONE WITH THE WOMAN HE LOVED HE CLASPED HER HAND POURING FORTH INCOHERENT WORDS OF THE MOST ARDENT GRATITUDE AND WHEN HE FELT HER WARMLY RETURN THE PRESSURE HE COULD NOT RESTRAIN THE DESIRE TO CLASP HER TO HIS HEART
IN SPITE OF HIS DEEP MENTAL DISTRESS HE COULD HAVE SHOUTED ALOUD IN HIS DELIGHT AND GRATITUDE
HE MIGHT NOW HAVE BEEN PERMITTED TO BIND FOREVER TO HIS LIFE THE WOMAN WHO HAD JUST RESCUED HIM FROM THE GREATEST DANGER BUT THE CONFESSION HE MUST MAKE TO HIS FELLOW ARTISTS IN THE PALAESTRA THE FOLLOWING MORNING STILL SEALED HIS LIPS YET IN THIS HOUR HE FELT THAT HE WAS UNITED TO HER AND OUGHT NOT TO CONCEAL WHAT AWAITED HIM SO OBEYING A STRONG IMPULSE HE EXCLAIMED YOU KNOW THAT I LOVE YOU
I LOVE YOU AND HAVE LOVED YOU ALWAYS
DAPHNE EXCLAIMED TENDERLY WHAT MORE IS NEEDED
BUT HERMON WITH DROOPING HEAD MURMURED TO MORROW I SHALL NO LONGER BE WHAT I AM NOW
THEN DAPHNE RAISED HER FACE TO HIS ASKING SO THE DEMETER IS THE WORK OF MYRTILUS
WHAT A TERRIBLE ORDEAL AGAIN AWAITS YOU
AND I FOOL BLINDED ALSO IN MIND COULD BE VEXED WITH YOU FOR IT
BRING THIS BEFORE YOUR MIND AND EVERYTHING ELSE THAT YOU MUST ACCEPT WITH IT IF YOU CONSENT WHEN THE TIME ARRIVES TO BECOME MINE CONCEAL AND PALLIATE NOTHING
SO ARCHIAS INTENDED TO LEAVE THE CITY ON ONE OF HIS OWN SHIPS THAT VERY DAY
HE HIMSELF ON THE WAY TO EXPOSE HIMSELF TO THE MALICE AND MOCKERY OF THE WHOLE CITY
HIS HEART CONTRACTED PAINFULLY AND HIS SOLICITUDE ABOUT HIS UNCLE'S FATE INCREASED WHEN PHILIPPUS INFORMED HIM THAT THE CONSPIRATORS HAD BEEN ARRESTED AT THE BANQUET AND HEADED BY AMYNTAS THE RHODIAN CHRYSIPPUS AND PROCLUS HAD PERISHED BY THE EXECUTIONER'S SWORD AT SUNRISE
BESIDES HE KNEW THAT THE OBJECT OF HIS LOVE WOULD NOT PART FROM HIM WITHOUT GRANTING HIM ONE LAST WORD
ON THE WAY HIS HEART THROBBED ALMOST TO BURSTING
EVEN DAPHNE'S IMAGE AND WHAT THREATENED HER FATHER AND HER WITH HIM RECEDED FAR INTO THE BACKGROUND
HE WAS APPEARING BEFORE HIS COMPANIONS ONLY TO GIVE TRUTH ITS JUST DUE
THE EGYPTIAN OBEYED AND HIS MASTER CROSSED THE WIDE SPACE STREWN WITH SAND AND APPROACHED THE STAGE WHICH HAD BEEN ERECTED FOR THE FESTAL PERFORMANCES EVEN HAD HIS EYES RETAINED THE POWER OF SIGHT HIS BLOOD WAS COURSING SO WILDLY THROUGH HIS VEINS THAT HE MIGHT PERHAPS HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO DISTINGUISH THE STATUES AROUND HIM AND THE THOUSANDS OF SPECTATORS WHO CROWDED CLOSELY TOGETHER RICHLY GARLANDED THEIR CHEEKS GLOWING WITH ENTHUSIASM SURROUNDED THE ARENA HERMON
SHOUTED HIS FRIEND SOTELES IN JOYFUL SURPRISE IN THE MIDST OF THIS PAINFUL WALK HERMON
EVEN WHILE HE BELIEVED HIMSELF TO BE THE CREATOR OF THE DEMETER HE HAD BEEN SERIOUSLY TROUBLED BY THE PRAISE OF SO MANY CRITICS BECAUSE IT HAD EXPOSED HIM TO THE SUSPICION OF HAVING BECOME FAITHLESS TO HIS ART AND HIS NATURE
HONOUR TO MYRTILUS AND HIS ART BUT HE TRUSTED THIS NOBLE FESTAL ASSEMBLAGE WOULD PARDON THE UNINTENTIONAL DECEPTION AND AID HIS PRAYER FOR RECOVERY
AND ALSO THESE
THEN SHE THREW HERSELF UPON HIM AND HE GATHERED HER TO HIS BOSOM AND THE TWAIN FELL DOWN IN A FAINTING FIT
WHEN THE EUNUCH SAW THIS CASE HE WONDERED AT THEM AND THROWING OVER THEM SOMEWHAT TO COVER THEM WAITED TILL THEY SHOULD RECOVER
AFTER A WHILE THEY CAME TO THEMSELVES AND NUZHAT AL ZAMAN REJOICED WITH EXCEEDING JOY OPPRESSION AND DEPRESSION LEFT HER AND GLADNESS TOOK THE MASTERY OF HER AND SHE REPEATED THESE VERSES
ACCORDINGLY SHE TOLD HIM ALL THAT HAD COME TO HER SINCE THEIR SEPARATION AT THE KHAN AND WHAT HAD HAPPENED TO HER WITH THE BADAWI HOW THE MERCHANT HAD BOUGHT HER OF HIM AND HAD TAKEN HER TO HER BROTHER SHARRKAN AND HAD SOLD HER TO HIM HOW HE HAD FREED HER AT THE TIME OF BUYING HOW HE HAD MADE A MARRIAGE CONTRACT WITH HER AND HAD GONE IN TO HER AND HOW THE KING THEIR SIRE HAD SENT AND ASKED FOR HER FROM SHARRKAN
BUT NOW GO TO THY MASTER AND BRING HIM QUICKLY TO ME
THE CHAMBERLAIN CALLED THE CASTRATO AND CHARGED HIM TO DO ACCORDINGLY SO HE REPLIED I HEAR AND I OBEY AND HE TOOK HIS PAGES WITH HIM AND WENT OUT IN SEARCH OF THE STOKER TILL HE FOUND HIM IN THE REAR OF THE CARAVAN GIRTHING HIS ASS AND PREPARING FOR FLIGHT
SHE SAID IT HATH REACHED ME O AUSPICIOUS KING THAT WHEN THE STOKER GIRTHED HIS ASS FOR FLIGHT AND BESPAKE HIMSELF SAYING OH WOULD I KNEW WHAT IS BECOME OF HIM
I BELIEVE HE HATH DENOUNCED ME TO THE EUNUCH HENCE THESE PAGES ET ABOUT ME AND HE HATH MADE ME AN ACCOMPLICE IN HIS CRIME
WHY DIDST THOU SAY I NEVER REPEATED THESE COUPLETS NOR DO I KNOW WHO REPEATED THEM WHEN IT WAS THY COMPANION
BUT NOW I WILL NOT LEAVE THEE BETWEEN THIS PLACE AND BAGHDAD AND WHAT BETIDETH THY COMRADE SHALL BETIDE THEE
TWAS AS I FEARED THE COMING ILLS DISCERNING BUT UNTO ALLAH WE ARE ALL RETURNING
THEN THE EUNUCH CRIED UPON THE PAGES SAYING TAKE HIM OFF THE ASS
AND HE ANSWERED I AM THE CHAMBERLAIN OF THE EMIR OF DAMASCUS KING SHARRKAN SON OF OMAR BIN AL NU'UMAN LORD OF BAGHDAD AND OF THE LAND OF KHORASAN AND I BRING TRIBUTE AND PRESENTS FROM HIM TO HIS FATHER IN BAGHDAD
SO FARE YE FORWARDS NO HARM SHALL BEFAL YOU TILL YOU JOIN HIS GRAND WAZIR DANDAN
THEN HE BADE HIM BE SEATED AND QUESTIONED HIM AND HE REPLIED THAT HE WAS CHAMBERLAIN TO THE EMIR OF DAMASCUS AND WAS BOUND TO KING OMAR WITH PRESENTS AND THE TRIBUTE OF SYRIA
SO IT WAS AGREED THAT WE GO TO DAMASCUS AND FETCH THENCE THE KING'S SON SHARRKAN AND MAKE HIM SULTAN OVER HIS FATHER'S REALM
AND AMONGST THEM WERE SOME WHO WOULD HAVE CHOSEN THE CADET ZAU AL MAKAN FOR QUOTH THEY HIS NAME BE LIGHT OF THE PLACE AND HE HATH A SISTER NUZHAT AL ZAMAN HIGHS THE DELIGHT OF THE TIME BUT THEY SET OUT FIVE YEARS AGO FOR AL HIJAZ AND NONE WOTTETH WHAT IS BECOME OF THEM
REPLIED HE OF A TRUTH I HEARD HIM NOT AND I WOT HIM NOT AND FOLKS ARE ALL SLEEPING
BUT SHE SAID WHOMSOEVER THOU SEEST AWAKE HE IS THE RECITER
THEN SAID THE EUNUCH ART THOU HE WHO REPEATED POETRY BUT NOW AND MY LADY HEARD HIM
REJOINED THE EUNUCH WHO THEN WAS THE RECITER POINT HIM OUT TO ME
BY ALLAH REPLIED THE FIREMAN I TELL THEE THE TRUTH
TELL ME WHAT HAPPENED QUOTH ZAU AL MAKAN
WHAT AILS THEE THEN THAT THOU MUST NEEDS RECITE VERSES SEEING THAT WE ARE TIRED OUT WITH WALKING AND WATCHING AND ALL THE FOLK ARE ASLEEP FOR THEY REQUIRE SLEEP TO REST THEM OF THEIR FATIGUE
AND HE ALSO IMPROVISED THE TWO FOLLOWING DISTICHS
WHEN NUZHAT AL ZAMAN HEARD THE FIRST IMPROVISATION SHE CALLED TO MIND HER FATHER AND HER MOTHER AND HER BROTHER AND THEIR WHILOME HOME THEN SHE WEPT AND CRIED AT THE EUNUCH AND SAID TO HIM WOE TO THEE
HE WHO RECITED THE FIRST TIME HATH RECITED A SECOND TIME AND I HEARD HIM HARD BY
BY ALLAH AN THOU FETCH HIM NOT TO ME I WILL ASSUREDLY ROUSE THE CHAMBERLAIN ON THEE AND HE SHALL BEAT THEE AND CAST THEE OUT
BUT TAKE THESE HUNDRED DINERS AND GIVE THEM TO THE SINGER AND BRING HIM TO ME GENTLY AND DO HIM NO HURT
RETURN QUICKLY AND LINGER NOT
WHEN IT WAS THE SEVENTY THIRD NIGHT
BUT THE EUNUCH SAID I WILL NOT LEAVE THEE TILL THOU SHOW ME WHO IT WAS THAT RECITED THE VERSES FOR I DREAD RETURNING TO MY LADY WITHOUT HIM
NOW WHEN THE FIREMAN HEARD THESE WORDS HE FEARED FOR ZAU AL MAKAN AND WEPT WITH EXCEEDING WEEPING AND SAID TO THE EUNUCH BY ALLAH IT WAS NOT I AND I KNOW HIM NOT
SO GO THOU TO THY STATION AND IF THOU AGAIN MEET ANY ONE AFTER THIS HOUR RECITING AUGHT OF POETRY WHETHER HE BE NEAR OR FAR IT WILL BE I OR SOME ONE I KNOW AND THOU SHALT NOT LEARN OF HIM BUT BY ME
THEN HE KISSED THE EUNUCH'S HEAD AND SPAKE HIM FAIR TILL HE WENT AWAY BUT THE CASTRATO FETCHED A ROUND AND RETURNING SECRETLY CAME AND STOOD BEHIND THE FIREMAN FEARING TO GO BACK TO HIS MISTRESS WITHOUT TIDINGS
I SAY WHAT MADE MY IGNOMY WHATE'ER THE BITTER CUP I DRAIN FAR BE FRO ME THAT LAND TO FLEE NOR WILL I BOW TO THOSE WHO BLAME AND FOR SUCH LOVE WOULD DEAL ME SHAME
THEN SAID THE EUNUCH TO ZAU AL MAKAN PEACE BE WITH THEE O MY LORD
O MY LORD CONTINUED THE EUNUCH AND SHAHRAZAD PERCEIVED THE DAWN OF DAY AND CEASED TO SAY HER PERMITTED SAY
WE WILL DO THEE NO UPRIGHT O MY SON NOR WRONG THEE IN AUGHT BUT OUR OBJECT IS THAT THOU BEND THY GRACIOUS STEPS WITH ME TO MY MISTRESS TO RECEIVE HER ANSWER AND RETURN IN WEAL AND SAFETY AND THOU SHALT HAVE A HANDSOME PRESENT AS ONE WHO BRINGETH GOOD NEWS
THEN THE EUNUCH WENT OUT TO ZAU AL MAKAN AND SAID TO HIM RECITE WHAT VERSES THOU KNOWEST FOR MY LADY IS HERE HARD BY LISTENING TO THEE AND AFTER I WILL ASK THEE OF THY NAME AND THY NATIVE COUNTRY AND THY CONDITION
SO HE TURNED TO THE WAZIR DANDAN AND SAID TO HIM VERILY YOUR TALE IS A WONDER OF WONDERS
KNOW O CHIEF WAZIR THAT HERE WHERE YOU HAVE ENCOUNTERED ME ALLAH HATH GIVEN YOU REST FROM FATIGUE AND BRINGETH YOU YOUR DESIRE AFTER THE EASIEST OF FASHIONS FOR THAT HIS ALMIGHTY WILL RESTORETH TO YOU ZAU AL MAKAN AND HIS SISTER NUZHAT AL ZAMAN WHEREBY WE WILL SETTLE THE MATTER AS WE EASILY CAN
WHEN THE MINISTER HEARD THESE WORDS HE REJOICED WITH GREAT JOY AND SAID O CHAMBERLAIN TELL ME THE TALE OF THE TWAIN AND WHAT BEFEL THEM AND THE CAUSE OF THEIR LONG ABSENCE
ZAU AL MAKAN BOWED HIS HEAD AWHILE AND THEN SAID I ACCEPT THIS POSITION FOR INDEED THERE WAS NO REFUSING AND HE WAS CERTIFIED THAT THE CHAMBERLAIN HAD COUNSELLED HIM WELL AND WISELY AND SET HIM ON THE RIGHT WAY
THEN HE ADDED O MY UNCLE HOW SHALL I DO WITH MY BROTHER SHARRKAN
AFTER AWHILE THE DUST DISPERSED AND THERE APPEARED UNDER IT THE ARMY OF BAGHDAD AND KHORASAN A CONQUERING HOST LIKE THE FULL TIDE SEA AND SHAHRAZAD PERCEIVED THE DAWN OF DAY AND CEASED TO SAY HER PERMITTED SAY
WHEN IT WAS THE SEVENTY EIGHTH NIGHT
AND IN IT ALL REJOICED AT THE ACCESSION OF THE LIGHT OF THE PLACE
LASTLY THE MINISTER WENT IN AND KISSED THE GROUND BEFORE ZAU AL MAKAN WHO ROSE TO MEET HIM SAYING WELCOME O WAZIR AND SIRE SANS PEER
MOREOVER THE SULTAN COMMANDED HIS WAZIR DANDAN CALL A TEN DAYS HALT OF THE ARMY THAT HE MIGHT BE PRIVATE WITH HIM AND LEARN FROM HIM HOW AND WHEREFORE HIS FATHER HAD BEEN SLAIN
HE THEN REPAIRED TO THE HEART OF THE ENCAMPMENT AND ORDERED THE HOST TO HALT TEN DAYS
SHE PULLED HER HAIR DOWN TURNED HER SKIRT BACK PUT HER FEET ON THE FENDER AND TOOK PUTTEL INTO HER LAP ALL OF WHICH ARRANGEMENTS SIGNIFIED THAT SOMETHING VERY IMPORTANT HAD GOT TO BE THOUGHT OVER AND SETTLED
THE MORE PROPOSALS THE MORE CREDIT
I VE TRIED IT AND LIKED IT AND MAYBE THIS IS THE CONSEQUENCE OF THAT NIGHT'S FUN
JUST SUPPOSE IT IS TRUE THAT HE DOES ASK ME AND I SAY YES
WHAT A SPITEFUL THING I AM
I COULD DO SO MUCH FOR ALL AT HOME HOW I SHOULD ENJOY THAT
LET ME SEE HOW CAN I BEGIN
HE HAS KNOWN HER ALL HER LIFE AND HAS A GOOD INFLUENCE OVER HER
NOW AS POLLY WAS BY NO MEANS A PERFECT CREATURE I AM FREE TO CONFESS THAT THE OLD TEMPTATION ASSAILED HER MORE THAN ONCE THAT WEEK FOR WHEN THE FIRST EXCITEMENT OF THE DODGING REFORM HAD SUBSIDED SHE MISSED THE PLEASANT LITTLE INTERVIEWS THAT USED TO PUT A CERTAIN FLAVOR OF ROMANCE INTO HER DULL HARD WORKING DAYS
I DON'T THINK IT WAS HIS WEALTH ACCOMPLISHMENTS OR POSITION THAT MOST ATTRACTED POLLY THOUGH THESE DOUBTLESS POSSESSED A GREATER INFLUENCE THAN SHE SUSPECTED
IT WAS THAT INDESCRIBABLE SOMETHING WHICH WOMEN ARE QUICK TO SEE AND FEEL IN MEN WHO HAVE BEEN BLESSED WITH WISE AND GOOD MOTHERS
THIS HAD AN ESPECIAL CHARM TO POLLY FOR SHE SOON FOUND THAT THIS SIDE OF HIS CHARACTER WAS NOT SHOWN TO EVERY ONE
LATELY THIS HAD CHANGED ESPECIALLY TOWARDS POLLY AND IT FLATTERED HER MORE THAN SHE WOULD CONFESS EVEN TO HERSELF
AT FIRST SHE TRIED TO THINK SHE COULD BUT UNFORTUNATELY HEARTS ARE SO CONTRARY THAT THEY WON'T BE OBEDIENT TO REASON WILL OR EVEN GRATITUDE
POLLY FELT A VERY CORDIAL FRIENDSHIP FOR MISTER SYDNEY BUT NOT ONE PARTICLE OF THE LOVE WHICH IS THE ONLY COIN IN WHICH LOVE CAN BE TRULY PAID
THIS FINISHED POLLY'S INDECISION AND AFTER THAT NIGHT SHE NEVER ALLOWED HERSELF TO DWELL UPON THE PLEASANT TEMPTATION WHICH CAME IN A GUISE PARTICULARLY ATTRACTIVE TO A YOUNG GIRL WITH A SPICE OF THE OLD EVE IN HER COMPOSITION
WHEN SATURDAY CAME POLLY STARTED AS USUAL FOR A VISIT TO BECKY AND BESS BUT COULD N'T RESIST STOPPING AT THE SHAWS TO LEAVE A LITTLE PARCEL FOR FAN THOUGH IT WAS CALLING TIME
A FOOLISH LITTLE SPEECH TO MAKE TO A DOG BUT YOU SEE POLLY WAS ONLY A TENDER HEARTED GIRL TRYING TO DO HER DUTY
TAKE HOLD OF MASTER CHARLEY'S HAND MISS MAMIE AND WALK PRETTY LIKE WILLY AND FLOSSY SAID THE MAID
AT A STREET CORNER A BLACK EYED SCHOOL BOY WAS PARTING FROM A ROSY FACED SCHOOL GIRL WHOSE MUSIC ROLL HE WAS RELUCTANTLY SURRENDERING
HOW HE GOT THERE WAS NEVER VERY CLEAR TO POLLY BUT THERE HE WAS FLUSHED AND A LITTLE OUT OF BREATH BUT LOOKING SO GLAD TO SEE HER THAT SHE HAD N'T THE HEART TO BE STIFF AND COOL AS SHE HAD FULLY INTENDED TO BE WHEN THEY MET
SHE REALLY COULD N'T HELP IT IT WAS SO PLEASANT TO SEE HIM AGAIN JUST WHEN SHE WAS FEELING SO LONELY
THAT IS THE WAY I GET TO THE ROTHS ANSWERED POLLY
SHE DID NOT MEAN TO TELL BUT HIS FRANKNESS WAS SO AGREEABLE SHE FORGOT HERSELF
BUT I KNOW HER BETTER AND I ASSURE YOU THAT SHE DOES IMPROVE SHE TRIES TO MEND HER FAULTS THOUGH SHE WON'T OWN IT AND WILL SURPRISE YOU SOME DAY BY THE AMOUNT OF HEART AND SENSE AND GOODNESS SHE HAS GOT
THANK YOU NO
HOW LOVELY THE PARK LOOKS SHE SAID IN GREAT CONFUSION
ASKED THE ARTFUL YOUNG MAN LAYING A TRAP INTO WHICH POLLY IMMEDIATELY FELL
HE WAS QUICKER TO TAKE A HINT THAN SHE HAD EXPECTED AND BEING BOTH PROUD AND GENEROUS RESOLVED TO SETTLE THE MATTER AT ONCE FOR POLLY'S SAKE AS WELL AS HIS OWN
SO WHEN SHE MADE HER LAST BRILLIANT REMARK HE SAID QUIETLY WATCHING HER FACE KEENLY ALL THE WHILE I THOUGHT SO WELL I M GOING OUT OF TOWN ON BUSINESS FOR SEVERAL WEEKS SO YOU CAN ENJOY YOUR LITTLE BIT OF COUNTRY WITHOUT BEING ANNOYED BY ME ANNOYED
SHE THOUGHT SHE HAD A GOOD DEAL OF THE COQUETTE IN HER AND I VE NO DOUBT THAT WITH TIME AND TRAINING SHE WOULD HAVE BECOME A VERY DANGEROUS LITTLE PERSON BUT NOW SHE WAS FAR TOO TRANSPARENT AND STRAIGHTFORWARD BY NATURE EVEN TO TELL A WHITE LIE CLEVERLY
HE WAS GONE BEFORE SHE COULD DO ANYTHING BUT LOOK UP AT HIM WITH A REMORSEFUL FACE AND SHE WALKED ON FEELING THAT THE FIRST AND PERHAPS THE ONLY LOVER SHE WOULD EVER HAVE HAD READ HIS ANSWER AND ACCEPTED IT IN SILENCE
POLLY DID NOT RETURN TO HER FAVORITE WALK TILL SHE LEARNED FROM MINNIE THAT UNCLE HAD REALLY LEFT TOWN AND THEN SHE FOUND THAT HIS FRIENDLY COMPANY AND CONVERSATION WAS WHAT HAD MADE THE WAY SO PLEASANT AFTER ALL
WAGGING TO AND FRO AS USUAL WHAT'S THE NEWS WITH YOU
PERHAPS SHE LL JILT HIM
UTTERLY DONE WITH AND LAID UPON THE SHELF
MINNIE SAID THE OTHER DAY SHE WISHED SHE WAS A PIGEON SO SHE COULD PADDLE IN THE PUDDLES AND NOT FUSS ABOUT RUBBERS
NOW DON'T BE AFFECTED POLLY BUT JUST TELL ME LIKE A DEAR HAS N'T HE PROPOSED
DON'T YOU THINK HE MEANS TO
TRULY TRULY FAN
I DON'T MEAN TO BE PRYING BUT I REALLY THOUGHT HE DID
WELL I ALWAYS MEANT TO TRY IT IF I GOT A CHANCE AND I HAVE
I JUST GAVE HIM A HINT AND HE TOOK IT
HE MEANT TO GO AWAY BEFORE THAT SO DON'T THINK HIS HEART IS BROKEN OR MIND WHAT SILLY TATTLERS SAY
HE UNDERSTOOD AND BEING A GENTLEMAN MADE NO FUSS
BUT POLLY IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A GRAND THING FOR YOU
I M ODD YOU KNOW AND PREFER TO BE AN INDEPENDENT SPINSTER AND TEACH MUSIC ALL MY DAYS
NEVER MIND WHAT THE BUSINESS WAS IT SUFFICES TO SAY THAT IT WAS A GOOD BEGINNING FOR A YOUNG MAN LIKE TOM WHO HAVING BEEN BORN AND BRED IN THE MOST CONSERVATIVE CLASS OF THE MOST CONCEITED CITY IN NEW ENGLAND NEEDED JUST THE HEALTHY HEARTY SOCIAL INFLUENCES OF THE WEST TO WIDEN HIS VIEWS AND MAKE A MAN OF HIM
FORTUNATELY EVERY ONE WAS SO BUSY WITH THE NECESSARY PREPARATIONS THAT THERE WAS NO TIME FOR ROMANCE OF ANY SORT AND THE FOUR YOUNG PEOPLE WORKED TOGETHER AS SOBERLY AND SENSIBLY AS IF ALL SORTS OF EMOTIONS WERE NOT BOTTLED UP IN THEIR RESPECTIVE HEARTS
PITY THAT THE END SHOULD COME SO SOON BUT THE HOUR DID ITS WORK AND WENT ITS WAY LEAVING A CLEARER ATMOSPHERE BEHIND THOUGH THE YOUNG FOLKS DID NOT SEE IT THEN FOR THEIR EYES WERE DIM BECAUSE OF THE PARTINGS THAT MUST BE
IF IT HAD NOT BEEN FOR TWO THINGS I FEAR SHE NEVER WOULD HAVE STOOD A SUMMER IN TOWN BUT SYDNEY OFTEN CALLED TILL HIS VACATION CAME AND A VOLUMINOUS CORRESPONDENCE WITH POLLY BEGUILED THE LONG DAYS
TOM WROTE ONCE A WEEK TO HIS MOTHER BUT THE LETTERS WERE SHORT AND NOT VERY SATISFACTORY FOR MEN NEVER DO TELL THE INTERESTING LITTLE THINGS THAT WOMEN BEST LIKE TO HEAR
NO I M ONLY TIRED HAD A GOOD DEAL TO DO LATELY AND THE DULL WEATHER MAKES ME JUST A TRIFLE BLUE
FORGIVE ME POLLY BUT I CAN'T HELP SAYING IT FOR IT IS THERE AND I WANT TO BE AS TRUE TO YOU AS YOU WERE TO ME IF I CAN
I TRY NOT TO DECEIVE MYSELF BUT IT DOES SEEM AS IF THERE WAS A CHANCE OF HAPPINESS FOR ME
THANK HEAVEN FOR THAT
CRIED POLLY WITH THE HEARTIEST SATISFACTION IN HER VOICE
POOR POLLY WAS SO TAKEN BY SURPRISE THAT SHE HAD NOT A WORD TO SAY
NONE WERE NEEDED HER TELLTALE FACE ANSWERED FOR HER AS WELL AS THE IMPULSE WHICH MADE HER HIDE HER HEAD IN THE SOFA CUSHION LIKE A FOOLISH OSTRICH WHEN THE HUNTERS ARE AFTER IT
ONCE OR TWICE BUT SORT OF JOKINGLY AND I THOUGHT IT WAS ONLY SOME LITTLE FLIRTATION
IT WAS SO STUPID OF ME NOT TO GUESS BEFORE
IT WAS SO TENDER EARNEST AND DEFIANT THAT FANNY FORGOT THE DEFENCE OF HER OWN LOVER IN ADMIRATION OF POLLY'S LOYALTY TO HERS FOR THIS FAITHFUL ALL ABSORBING LOVE WAS A NEW REVELATION TO FANNY WHO WAS USED TO HEARING HER FRIENDS BOAST OF TWO OR THREE LOVERS A YEAR AND CALCULATE THEIR RESPECTIVE VALUES WITH ALMOST AS MUCH COOLNESS AS THE YOUNG MEN DISCUSSED THE FORTUNES OF THE GIRLS THEY WISHED FOR BUT COULD NOT AFFORD TO MARRY
I HOPE MARIA BAILEY IS ALL HE THINKS HER SHE ADDED SOFTLY FOR I COULD N'T BEAR TO HAVE HIM DISAPPOINTED AGAIN
SAID FANNY TURNING HOPEFUL ALL AT ONCE
SUPPOSE I SAY A WORD TO TOM JUST INQUIRE AFTER HIS HEART IN A GENERAL WAY YOU KNOW AND GIVE HIM A CHANCE TO TELL ME IF THERE IS ANYTHING TO TELL
BEAR IT PEOPLE ALWAYS DO BEAR THINGS SOMEHOW ANSWERED POLLY LOOKING AS IF SENTENCE HAD BEEN PASSED UPON HER
IT WAS A VERY DIFFERENT WINTER FROM THE LAST FOR BOTH THE GIRLS
IF FANNY WANTED TO SHOW HIM WHAT SHE COULD DO TOWARD MAKING A PLEASANT HOME SHE CERTAINLY SUCCEEDED BETTER THAN SHE SUSPECTED FOR IN SPITE OF MANY FAILURES AND DISCOURAGEMENTS BEHIND THE SCENES THE LITTLE HOUSE BECAME A MOST ATTRACTIVE PLACE TO MISTER SYDNEY AT LEAST FOR HE WAS MORE THE HOUSE FRIEND THAN EVER AND SEEMED DETERMINED TO PROVE THAT CHANGE OF FORTUNE MADE NO DIFFERENCE TO HIM
SHE KEPT MUCH AT HOME WHEN THE DAY'S WORK WAS DONE FINDING IT PLEASANTER TO SIT DREAMING OVER BOOK OR SEWING ALONE THAN TO EXERT HERSELF EVEN TO GO TO THE SHAWS
POLLY WAS NOT AT ALL LIKE HERSELF THAT WINTER AND THOSE NEAREST TO HER SAW AND WONDERED AT IT MOST
FOR NED WAS SO ABSORBED IN BUSINESS THAT HE IGNORED THE WHOLE BAILEY QUESTION AND LEFT THEM IN UTTER DARKNESS
FANNY CAME WALKING IN UPON HER ONE DAY LOOKING AS IF SHE BROUGHT TIDINGS OF SUCH GREAT JOY THAT SHE HARDLY KNEW HOW TO TELL THEM
BUT IF WORK BASKETS WERE GIFTED WITH POWERS OF SPEECH THEY COULD TELL STORIES MORE TRUE AND TENDER THAN ANY WE READ
VAIN HOPE I FEAR
MISTER AND MISSUS HATTERSLEY HAVE BEEN STAYING AT THE GROVE A FORTNIGHT AND AS MISTER HARGRAVE IS STILL ABSENT AND THE WEATHER WAS REMARKABLY FINE I NEVER PASSED A DAY WITHOUT SEEING MY TWO FRIENDS MILICENT AND ESTHER EITHER THERE OR HERE
NO UNLESS YOU CAN TELL ME WHEN TO EXPECT HIM HOME
I CAN'T YOU DON'T WANT HIM DO YOU
IT IS A RESOLUTION YOU OUGHT TO HAVE FORMED LONG AGO
WE ALL HAVE A BIT OF A LIKING FOR HIM AT THE BOTTOM OF OUR HEARTS THOUGH WE CAN'T RESPECT HIM
NO I'D RATHER BE LIKE MYSELF BAD AS I AM
NEVER MIND MY PLAIN SPEAKING SAID I IT IS FROM THE BEST OF MOTIVES
BUT TELL ME SHOULD YOU WISH YOUR SONS TO BE LIKE MISTER HUNTINGDON OR EVEN LIKE YOURSELF
OH NO I COULDN'T STAND THAT
FIRE AND FURY
NOW DON'T BURST INTO A TEMPEST AT THAT
BUT HANG IT THAT'S NOT MY FAULT
NOT YEARS FOR SHE'S ONLY FIVE AND TWENTY
WHAT WOULD YOU MAKE OF ME AND THE CHILDREN TO BE SURE THAT WORRY HER TO DEATH BETWEEN THEM
I KNOW THEY ARE BLESS THEM
HE FOLLOWED ME INTO THE LIBRARY
I SOUGHT OUT AND PUT INTO HIS HANDS TWO OF MILICENT'S LETTERS ONE DATED FROM LONDON AND WRITTEN DURING ONE OF HIS WILDEST SEASONS OF RECKLESS DISSIPATION THE OTHER IN THE COUNTRY DURING A LUCID INTERVAL
THE FORMER WAS FULL OF TROUBLE AND ANGUISH NOT ACCUSING HIM BUT DEEPLY REGRETTING HIS CONNECTION WITH HIS PROFLIGATE COMPANIONS ABUSING MISTER GRIMSBY AND OTHERS INSINUATING BITTER THINGS AGAINST MISTER HUNTINGDON AND MOST INGENIOUSLY THROWING THE BLAME OF HER HUSBAND'S MISCONDUCT ON TO OTHER MEN'S SHOULDERS
I'VE BEEN A CURSED RASCAL GOD KNOWS SAID HE AS HE GAVE IT A HEARTY SQUEEZE BUT YOU SEE IF I DON'T MAKE AMENDS FOR IT D N ME IF I DON'T
IF YOU INTEND TO REFORM INVOKE GOD'S BLESSING HIS MERCY AND HIS AID NOT HIS CURSE
GOD HELP ME THEN FOR I'M SURE I NEED IT
WHERE'S MILICENT
NAY NOT I SAID HE TURNING HER ROUND AND PUSHING HER TOWARDS ME
MILICENT FLEW TO THANK ME OVERFLOWING WITH GRATITUDE
CRIED SHE I COULDN'T HAVE INFLUENCED HIM I'M SURE BY ANYTHING THAT I COULD HAVE SAID
YOU NEVER TRIED ME MILLY SAID HE
AFTER THAT THEY WILL REPAIR TO THEIR COUNTRY HOME
WHEN CHURCHYARDS YAWN
I KNEW WELL ENOUGH THAT HE MIGHT BE CARRIED THOUSANDS OF MILES IN THE BOX CAR LOCKED IN PERHAPS WITHOUT WATER OR FOOD
I AM SURE I KISSED LIDDY AND I HAVE HAD TERRIBLE MOMENTS SINCE WHEN I SEEM TO REMEMBER KISSING MISTER JAMIESON TOO IN THE EXCITEMENT
FORTUNATELY WARNER AND THE DETECTIVES WERE KEEPING BACHELOR HALL IN THE LODGE
OUT OF DEFERENCE TO LIDDY THEY WASHED THEIR DISHES ONCE A DAY AND THEY CONCOCTED QUEER MESSES ACCORDING TO THEIR SEVERAL ABILITIES
MISS INNES HE SAID STOPPING ME AS I WAS ABOUT TO GO TO MY ROOM UP STAIRS HOW ARE YOUR NERVES TONIGHT
I HAVE NONE I SAID HAPPILY
I MEAN HE PERSISTED DO YOU FEEL AS THOUGH YOU COULD GO THROUGH WITH SOMETHING RATHER UNUSUAL
THE MOST UNUSUAL THING I CAN THINK OF WOULD BE A PEACEFUL NIGHT
SOMETHING IS GOING TO OCCUR HE SAID
PUT ON HEAVY SHOES AND SOME OLD DARK CLOTHES AND MAKE UP YOUR MIND NOT TO BE SURPRISED AT ANYTHING
LIDDY WAS SLEEPING THE SLEEP OF THE JUST WHEN I WENT UP STAIRS AND I HUNTED OUT MY THINGS CAUTIOUSLY
THEY WERE TALKING CONFIDENTIALLY TOGETHER BUT WHEN I CAME DOWN THEY CEASED
THERE WERE A FEW PREPARATIONS TO BE MADE THE LOCKS TO BE GONE OVER WINTERS TO BE INSTRUCTED AS TO RENEWED VIGILANCE AND THEN AFTER EXTINGUISHING THE HALL LIGHT WE CREPT IN THE DARKNESS THROUGH THE FRONT DOOR AND INTO THE NIGHT
I ASKED NO QUESTIONS
ONCE ONLY SOMEBODY SPOKE AND THEN IT WAS AN EMPHATIC BIT OF PROFANITY FROM DOCTOR STEWART WHEN HE RAN INTO A WIRE FENCE
I HARDLY KNOW WHAT I EXPECTED
THE DOCTOR WAS PUFFING SOMEWHAT WHEN WE FINALLY CAME TO A HALT
I CONFESS THAT JUST AT THAT MINUTE EVEN SUNNYSIDE SEEMED A CHEERFUL SPOT
IN SPITE OF MYSELF I DREW MY BREATH IN SHARPLY
IT WAS ALEX ARMED WITH TWO LONG HANDLED SPADES
THE DOCTOR KEPT A KEEN LOOKOUT BUT NO ONE APPEARED
THERE'S ONE THING SURE I'LL NOT BE SUSPECTED OF COMPLICITY
A DOCTOR IS GENERALLY SUPPOSED TO BE HANDIER AT BURYING FOLKS THAN AT DIGGING THEM UP
I HELD ON TO HIM FRANTICALLY AND SOMEHOW I GOT THERE AND LOOKED DOWN
BUT HOW AM I TO GET OVER THE TEN OR TWELVE DAYS THAT MUST YET ELAPSE BEFORE THEY GO
FOR NONE COULD INJURE ME AS HE HAS DONE OH
THE WORD STARES ME IN THE FACE LIKE A GUILTY CONFESSION BUT IT IS TRUE I HATE HIM I HATE HIM
I SOMETIMES THINK I OUGHT TO GIVE HIM CREDIT FOR THE GOOD FEELING HE SIMULATES SO WELL AND THEN AGAIN I THINK IT IS MY DUTY TO SUSPECT HIM UNDER THE PECULIAR CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH I AM PLACED
I HAVE DONE WELL TO RECORD THEM SO MINUTELY
THEY HAD BETAKEN THEMSELVES TO THEIR WORK I LESS TO DIVERT MY MIND THAN TO DEPRECATE CONVERSATION HAD PROVIDED MYSELF WITH A BOOK
I AM TOO WELL ACQUAINTED WITH YOUR CHARACTER AND CONDUCT TO FEEL ANY REAL FRIENDSHIP FOR YOU AND AS I AM WITHOUT YOUR TALENT FOR DISSIMULATION I CANNOT ASSUME THE APPEARANCE OF IT
UPON PERUSING THIS SHE TURNED SCARLET AND BIT HER LIP
YOU MAY GO MILICENT AND SHE'LL FOLLOW IN A WHILE MILICENT WENT
WILL YOU OBLIGE ME HELEN CONTINUED SHE
AH YOU ARE SUSPICIOUS
IF I WERE SUSPICIOUS I REPLIED I SHOULD HAVE DISCOVERED YOUR INFAMY LONG BEFORE
I ENJOY A MOONLIGHT RAMBLE AS WELL AS YOU I ANSWERED STEADILY FIXING MY EYES UPON HER AND THE SHRUBBERY HAPPENS TO BE ONE OF MY FAVOURITE RESORTS
SHE COLOURED AGAIN EXCESSIVELY AND REMAINED SILENT PRESSING HER FINGER AGAINST HER TEETH AND GAZING INTO THE FIRE
I WATCHED HER A FEW MOMENTS WITH A FEELING OF MALEVOLENT GRATIFICATION THEN MOVING TOWARDS THE DOOR I CALMLY ASKED IF SHE HAD ANYTHING MORE TO SAY
YES YES
SUPPOSE I DO
SHE PAUSED IN EVIDENT DISCONCERTION AND PERPLEXITY MINGLED WITH ANGER SHE DARED NOT SHOW
I CANNOT RENOUNCE WHAT IS DEARER THAN LIFE SHE MUTTERED IN A LOW HURRIED TONE
IF YOU ARE GENEROUS HERE IS A FITTING OPPORTUNITY FOR THE EXERCISE OF YOUR MAGNANIMITY IF YOU ARE PROUD HERE AM I YOUR RIVAL READY TO ACKNOWLEDGE MYSELF YOUR DEBTOR FOR AN ACT OF THE MOST NOBLE FORBEARANCE
I SHALL NOT TELL HIM
GIVE ME NO THANKS IT IS NOT FOR YOUR SAKE THAT I REFRAIN
AND MILICENT WILL YOU TELL HER
I WOULD NOT FOR MUCH THAT SHE SHOULD KNOW THE INFAMY AND DISGRACE OF HER RELATION
YOU USE HARD WORDS MISSUS HUNTINGDON BUT I CAN PARDON YOU
HOW DARE YOU MENTION HIS NAME TO ME
IT SEEMS VERY INTERESTING LOVE SAID HE LIFTING HIS HEAD AND TURNING TO WHERE I STOOD WRINGING MY HANDS IN SILENT RAGE AND ANGUISH BUT IT'S RATHER LONG I'LL LOOK AT IT SOME OTHER TIME AND MEANWHILE I'LL TROUBLE YOU FOR YOUR KEYS MY DEAR WHAT KEYS
THE KEYS OF YOUR CABINET DESK DRAWERS AND WHATEVER ELSE YOU POSSESS SAID HE RISING AND HOLDING OUT HIS HAND
THE KEY OF MY DESK IN FACT WAS AT THAT MOMENT IN THE LOCK AND THE OTHERS WERE ATTACHED TO IT
NOW THEN SNEERED HE WE MUST HAVE A CONFISCATION OF PROPERTY
AND PUTTING THE KEYS INTO HIS POCKET HE WALKED INTO THE LIBRARY
THAT AND ALL REPLIED THE MASTER AND THE THINGS WERE CLEARED AWAY
MISTER HUNTINGDON THEN WENT UP STAIRS
MUTTERED HE STARTING BACK SHE'S THE VERY DEVIL FOR SPITE
I DIDN'T SAY I'D BROKEN IT DID I RETURNED HE
I SHALL PUT YOU UPON A SMALL MONTHLY ALLOWANCE IN FUTURE FOR YOUR OWN PRIVATE EXPENSES AND YOU NEEDN'T TROUBLE YOURSELF ANY MORE ABOUT MY CONCERNS I SHALL LOOK OUT FOR A STEWARD MY DEAR I WON'T EXPOSE YOU TO THE TEMPTATION
AND AS FOR THE HOUSEHOLD MATTERS MISSUS GREAVES MUST BE VERY PARTICULAR IN KEEPING HER ACCOUNTS WE MUST GO UPON AN ENTIRELY NEW PLAN
WHAT GREAT DISCOVERY HAVE YOU MADE NOW MISTER HUNTINGDON
HAVE I ATTEMPTED TO DEFRAUD YOU
NOT IN MONEY MATTERS EXACTLY IT SEEMS BUT IT'S BEST TO KEEP OUT OF THE WAY OF TEMPTATION
HERE BENSON ENTERED WITH THE CANDLES AND THERE FOLLOWED A BRIEF INTERVAL OF SILENCE I SITTING STILL IN MY CHAIR AND HE STANDING WITH HIS BACK TO THE FIRE SILENTLY TRIUMPHING IN MY DESPAIR
I KNOW THAT DAY AFTER DAY SUCH FEELINGS WILL RETURN UPON ME
I TRY TO LOOK TO HIM AND RAISE MY HEART TO HEAVEN BUT IT WILL CLEAVE TO THE DUST
SHE HAD EVEN BEEN IN SOCIETY BEFORE THE REVOLUTION
IT WAS HER PLEASURE AND HER VANITY TO DRAG IN THESE NAMES ON EVERY PRETEXT
EVERY YEAR SHE SOLEMNLY RENEWED HER VOWS AND AT THE MOMENT OF TAKING THE OATH SHE SAID TO THE PRIEST MONSEIGNEUR SAINT FRANCOIS GAVE IT TO MONSEIGNEUR SAINT JULIEN MONSEIGNEUR SAINT JULIEN GAVE IT TO MONSEIGNEUR SAINT EUSEBIUS MONSEIGNEUR SAINT EUSEBIUS GAVE IT TO MONSEIGNEUR SAINT PROCOPIUS ET CETERA ET CETERA
AND THE SCHOOL GIRLS WOULD BEGIN TO LAUGH NOT IN THEIR SLEEVES BUT UNDER THEIR VEILS CHARMING LITTLE STIFLED LAUGHS WHICH MADE THE VOCAL MOTHERS FROWN
IT WAS A CENTURY WHICH SPOKE THROUGH HER BUT IT WAS THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY
THE RULE OF FONTEVRAULT DID NOT FORBID THIS
SHE WOULD NOT SHOW THIS OBJECT TO ANYONE
THUS IT FURNISHED A SUBJECT OF COMMENT FOR ALL THOSE WHO WERE UNOCCUPIED OR BORED IN THE CONVENT
SOME UNIQUE CHAPLET SOME AUTHENTIC RELIC
THEY LOST THEMSELVES IN CONJECTURES
WHEN THE POOR OLD WOMAN DIED THEY RUSHED TO HER CUPBOARD MORE HASTILY THAN WAS FITTING PERHAPS AND OPENED IT
HE IS RESISTING FLUTTERING HIS TINY WINGS AND STILL MAKING AN EFFORT TO FLY BUT THE DANCER IS LAUGHING WITH A SATANICAL AIR
MORAL LOVE CONQUERED BY THE COLIC
THE PRIORESS RETURNED AND SEATED HERSELF ONCE MORE ON HER CHAIR
WE WILL PRESENT A STENOGRAPHIC REPORT OF THE DIALOGUE WHICH THEN ENSUED TO THE BEST OF OUR ABILITY
FATHER FAUVENT
REVEREND MOTHER DO YOU KNOW THE CHAPEL
AND YOU HAVE BEEN IN THE CHOIR IN PURSUANCE OF YOUR DUTIES TWO OR THREE TIMES
THERE IS A STONE TO BE RAISED HEAVY
THE SLAB OF THE PAVEMENT WHICH IS AT THE SIDE OF THE ALTAR
THE SLAB WHICH CLOSES THE VAULT YES
IT WOULD BE A GOOD THING TO HAVE TWO MEN FOR IT
A WOMAN IS NEVER A MAN
BECAUSE DOM MABILLON GIVES FOUR HUNDRED AND SEVENTEEN EPISTLES OF SAINT BERNARD WHILE MERLONUS HORSTIUS ONLY GIVES THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY SEVEN I DO NOT DESPISE MERLONUS HORSTIUS NEITHER DO I
MERIT CONSISTS IN WORKING ACCORDING TO ONE'S STRENGTH A CLOISTER IS NOT A DOCK YARD
AND A WOMAN IS NOT A MAN BUT MY BROTHER IS THE STRONG ONE THOUGH
AND CAN YOU GET A LEVER
THERE IS A RING IN THE STONE
I WILL PUT THE LEVER THROUGH IT
THAT IS GOOD REVEREND MOTHER I WILL OPEN THE VAULT
WILL THAT BE ALL NO
GIVE ME YOUR ORDERS VERY REVEREND MOTHER
FAUVENT WE HAVE CONFIDENCE IN YOU
I AM HERE TO DO ANYTHING YOU WISH
AND TO HOLD YOUR PEACE ABOUT EVERYTHING YES REVEREND MOTHER
WHEN THE VAULT IS OPEN I WILL CLOSE IT AGAIN
BUT BEFORE THAT WHAT REVEREND MOTHER
FATHER FAUVENT REVEREND MOTHER
YOU KNOW THAT A MOTHER DIED THIS MORNING
NO DID YOU NOT HEAR THE BELL
NOTHING CAN BE HEARD AT THE BOTTOM OF THE GARDEN REALLY
AND THEN THE WIND IS NOT BLOWING IN MY DIRECTION THIS MORNING
IT WAS MOTHER CRUCIFIXION
THREE YEARS AGO MADAME DE BETHUNE A JANSENIST TURNED ORTHODOX MERELY FROM HAVING SEEN MOTHER CRUCIFIXION AT PRAYER AH
THE MOTHERS HAVE TAKEN HER TO THE DEAD ROOM WHICH OPENS ON THE CHURCH I KNOW
A FINE SIGHT IT WOULD BE TO SEE A MAN ENTER THE DEAD ROOM MORE OFTEN
HEY MORE OFTEN
WHAT DO YOU SAY
I SAY MORE OFTEN MORE OFTEN THAN WHAT
REVEREND MOTHER I DID NOT SAY MORE OFTEN THAN WHAT I SAID MORE OFTEN
BUT I DID NOT SAY MORE OFTEN
AT THAT MOMENT NINE O'CLOCK STRUCK
AT NINE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING AND AT ALL HOURS PRAISED AND ADORED BE THE MOST HOLY SACRAMENT OF THE ALTAR SAID THE PRIORESS
IT CUT MORE OFTEN SHORT
FAUCHELEVENT MOPPED HIS FOREHEAD
IN HER LIFETIME MOTHER CRUCIFIXION MADE CONVERTS AFTER HER DEATH SHE WILL PERFORM MIRACLES SHE WILL
FATHER FAUVENT THE COMMUNITY HAS BEEN BLESSED IN MOTHER CRUCIFIXION
SHE RETAINED HER CONSCIOUSNESS TO THE VERY LAST MOMENT
SHE GAVE US HER LAST COMMANDS
IF YOU HAD A LITTLE MORE FAITH AND IF YOU COULD HAVE BEEN IN HER CELL SHE WOULD HAVE CURED YOUR LEG MERELY BY TOUCHING IT SHE SMILED
THERE WAS SOMETHING OF PARADISE IN THAT DEATH
FAUCHELEVENT THOUGHT THAT IT WAS AN ORISON WHICH SHE WAS FINISHING
FAUCHELEVENT HELD HIS PEACE SHE WENT ON
I HAVE CONSULTED UPON THIS POINT MANY ECCLESIASTICS LABORING IN OUR LORD WHO OCCUPY THEMSELVES IN THE EXERCISES OF THE CLERICAL LIFE AND WHO BEAR WONDERFUL FRUIT
FORTUNATELY THE PRIORESS COMPLETELY ABSORBED IN HER OWN THOUGHTS DID NOT HEAR IT
SHE CONTINUED FATHER FAUVENT
YES REVEREND MOTHER
SAINT TERENTIUS BISHOP OF PORT WHERE THE MOUTH OF THE TIBER EMPTIES INTO THE SEA REQUESTED THAT ON HIS TOMB MIGHT BE ENGRAVED THE SIGN WHICH WAS PLACED ON THE GRAVES OF PARRICIDES IN THE HOPE THAT PASSERS BY WOULD SPIT ON HIS TOMB THIS WAS DONE
THE DEAD MUST BE OBEYED SO BE IT
FOR THAT MATTER NO REVEREND MOTHER
FATHER FAUVENT MOTHER CRUCIFIXION WILL BE INTERRED IN THE COFFIN IN WHICH SHE HAS SLEPT FOR THE LAST TWENTY YEARS THAT IS JUST
IT IS A CONTINUATION OF HER SLUMBER
SO I SHALL HAVE TO NAIL UP THAT COFFIN YES
I AM AT THE ORDERS OF THE VERY REVEREND COMMUNITY
THE FOUR MOTHER PRECENTORS WILL ASSIST YOU
NO IN LOWERING THE COFFIN
WHERE INTO THE VAULT
FAUCHELEVENT STARTED THE VAULT UNDER THE ALTAR
UNDER THE ALTAR BUT
YOU WILL HAVE AN IRON BAR YES BUT
YOU WILL RAISE THE STONE WITH THE BAR BY MEANS OF THE RING BUT
THE DEAD MUST BE OBEYED TO BE BURIED IN THE VAULT UNDER THE ALTAR OF THE CHAPEL NOT TO GO TO PROFANE EARTH TO REMAIN THERE IN DEATH WHERE SHE PRAYED WHILE LIVING SUCH WAS THE LAST WISH OF MOTHER CRUCIFIXION
SHE ASKED IT OF US THAT IS TO SAY COMMANDED US
BUT IT IS FORBIDDEN
OH I AM A STONE IN YOUR WALLS
THINK FATHER FAUVENT IF SHE WERE TO WORK MIRACLES HERE
WHAT A GLORY OF GOD FOR THE COMMUNITY AND MIRACLES ISSUE FROM TOMBS
BUT REVEREND MOTHER IF THE AGENT OF THE SANITARY COMMISSION
BUT THE COMMISSARY OF POLICE
CHONODEMAIRE ONE OF THE SEVEN GERMAN KINGS WHO ENTERED AMONG THE GAULS UNDER THE EMPIRE OF CONSTANTIUS EXPRESSLY RECOGNIZED THE RIGHT OF NUNS TO BE BURIED IN RELIGION THAT IS TO SAY BENEATH THE ALTAR
THE WORLD IS NOTHING IN THE PRESENCE OF THE CROSS
MARTIN THE ELEVENTH GENERAL OF THE CARTHUSIANS GAVE TO HIS ORDER THIS DEVICE STAT CRUX DUM VOLVITUR ORBIS
THE PRIORESS WHO WAS USUALLY SUBJECTED TO THE BARRIER OF SILENCE AND WHOSE RESERVOIR WAS OVERFULL ROSE AND EXCLAIMED WITH THE LOQUACITY OF A DAM WHICH HAS BROKEN AWAY
I HAVE ON MY RIGHT BENOIT AND ON MY LEFT BERNARD WHO WAS BERNARD
THE FIRST ABBOT OF CLAIRVAUX
HIS ORDER HAS PRODUCED FORTY POPES TWO HUNDRED CARDINALS FIFTY PATRIARCHS SIXTEEN HUNDRED ARCHBISHOPS FOUR THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED BISHOPS FOUR EMPERORS TWELVE EMPRESSES FORTY SIX KINGS FORTY ONE QUEENS THREE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED CANONIZED SAINTS AND HAS BEEN IN EXISTENCE FOR FOURTEEN HUNDRED YEARS
ON ONE SIDE SAINT BERNARD ON THE OTHER THE AGENT OF THE SANITARY DEPARTMENT
GOD SUBORDINATED TO THE COMMISSARY OF POLICE SUCH IS THE AGE SILENCE FAUVENT
NO ONE DOUBTS THE RIGHT OF THE MONASTERY TO SEPULTURE
ONLY FANATICS AND THOSE IN ERROR DENY IT
WE LIVE IN TIMES OF TERRIBLE CONFUSION
WE ARE IGNORANT AND IMPIOUS
AND THEN RELIGION IS ATTACKED WHY
BECAUSE THERE HAVE BEEN BAD PRIESTS BECAUSE SAGITTAIRE BISHOP OF GAP WAS THE BROTHER OF SALONE BISHOP OF EMBRUN AND BECAUSE BOTH OF THEM FOLLOWED MOMMOL
THEY PERSECUTE THE SAINTS
THEY SHUT THEIR EYES TO THE TRUTH DARKNESS IS THE RULE
THE MOST FEROCIOUS BEASTS ARE BEASTS WHICH ARE BLIND
OH HOW WICKED PEOPLE ARE
BY ORDER OF THE KING SIGNIFIES TO DAY BY ORDER OF THE REVOLUTION
ONE NO LONGER KNOWS WHAT IS DUE TO THE LIVING OR TO THE DEAD A HOLY DEATH IS PROHIBITED
GAUTHIER BISHOP OF CHALONS HELD HIS OWN IN THIS MATTER AGAINST OTHO DUKE OF BURGUNDY
THE PRIORESS TOOK BREATH THEN TURNED TO FAUCHELEVENT
YOU WILL CLOSE THE COFFIN THE SISTERS WILL CARRY IT TO THE CHAPEL
THE OFFICE FOR THE DEAD WILL THEN BE SAID
BUT SHE WILL HEAR SHE WILL NOT LISTEN
BESIDES WHAT THE CLOISTER KNOWS THE WORLD LEARNS NOT
A PAUSE ENSUED
YOU WILL REMOVE YOUR BELL
HAS THE DOCTOR FOR THE DEAD PAID HIS VISIT
HE WILL PAY IT AT FOUR O'CLOCK TO DAY
THE PEAL WHICH ORDERS THE DOCTOR FOR THE DEAD TO BE SUMMONED HAS ALREADY BEEN RUNG
BUT YOU DO NOT UNDERSTAND ANY OF THE PEALS
THAT IS WELL FATHER FAUVENT
WHERE WILL YOU OBTAIN IT
I HAVE MY HEAP OF OLD IRON AT THE BOTTOM OF THE GARDEN
REVEREND MOTHER WHAT
IF YOU WERE EVER TO HAVE ANY OTHER JOBS OF THIS SORT MY BROTHER IS THE STRONG MAN FOR YOU A PERFECT TURK
YOU WILL DO IT AS SPEEDILY AS POSSIBLE
I CANNOT WORK VERY FAST I AM INFIRM THAT IS WHY I REQUIRE AN ASSISTANT I LIMP
EVERYTHING MUST HAVE BEEN COMPLETED A GOOD QUARTER OF AN HOUR BEFORE THAT
I WILL DO ANYTHING TO PROVE MY ZEAL TOWARDS THE COMMUNITY THESE ARE MY ORDERS I AM TO NAIL UP THE COFFIN
AT ELEVEN O'CLOCK EXACTLY I AM TO BE IN THE CHAPEL
MOTHER ASCENSION WILL BE THERE TWO MEN WOULD BE BETTER
HOWEVER NEVER MIND I SHALL HAVE MY LEVER
AFTER WHICH THERE WILL BE NO TRACE OF ANYTHING
THE GOVERNMENT WILL HAVE NO SUSPICION
THE EMPTY COFFIN REMAINS THIS PRODUCED A PAUSE
WHAT IS TO BE DONE WITH THAT COFFIN FATHER FAUVENT
IT WILL BE GIVEN TO THE EARTH EMPTY
AH THE DE EXCLAIMED FAUCHELEVENT
THE VIL STUCK FAST IN HIS THROAT
HE MADE HASTE TO IMPROVISE AN EXPEDIENT TO MAKE HER FORGET THE OATH
I WILL PUT EARTH IN THE COFFIN REVEREND MOTHER THAT WILL PRODUCE THE EFFECT OF A CORPSE
I WILL MAKE THAT MY SPECIAL BUSINESS
THESE HATREDS WERE SOON TO MAKE TROUBLE FOR ME OF WHICH I HAD NEVER DREAMED
HENRY WASHINGTON YOUNGER MY FATHER REPRESENTED JACKSON COUNTY THREE TIMES IN THE LEGISLATURE AND WAS ALSO JUDGE OF THE COUNTY COURT
MY MOTHER WHO WAS BURSHEBA FRISTOE OF INDEPENDENCE WAS THE DAUGHTER OF RICHARD FRISTOE WHO FOUGHT UNDER GENERAL ANDREW JACKSON AT NEW ORLEANS JACKSON COUNTY HAVING BEEN SO NAMED AT MY GRANDFATHER FRISTOE'S INSISTENCE
I CANNOT REMEMBER WHEN I DID NOT KNOW HOW TO SHOOT
MY BROTHER JAMES WAS BORN JANUARY FIFTEENTH EIGHTEEN FORTY EIGHT JOHN IN EIGHTEEN FIFTY ONE AND ROBERT IN DECEMBER EIGHTEEN FIFTY THREE
MY ELDEST BROTHER RICHARD DIED IN EIGHTEEN SIXTY
MY FATHER WAS IN THE EMPLOY OF THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT AND HAD THE MAIL CONTRACT FOR FIVE HUNDRED MILES
HE HAD STARTED BACK TO HARRISONVILLE IN A BUGGY BUT WAS WAYLAID ONE MILE SOUTH OF WESTPORT A SUBURB OF KANSAS CITY AND BRUTALLY MURDERED FALLING OUT OF HIS BUGGY INTO THE ROAD WITH THREE MORTAL BULLET WOUNDS
MISSUS WASHINGTON WELLS AND HER SON SAMUEL ON THE ROAD HOME FROM KANSAS CITY TO LEE'S SUMMIT RECOGNIZED THE BODY AS THAT OF MY FATHER
MISSUS WELLS STAYED TO GUARD THE REMAINS WHILE HER SON CARRIED THE NEWS OF THE MURDER TO COLONEL PEABODY OF THE FEDERAL COMMAND WHO WAS THEN IN CAMP AT KANSAS CITY
MISSUS MC CORKLE JUMPED FROM THE WINDOW OF THE HOUSE AND ESCAPED
AS THE RAIDERS LEFT ONE OF THEM SHOUTED
NOW OLD LADY CALL ON YOUR PROTECTORS WHY DON'T YOU CALL ON COLE YOUNGER NOW
EVERY KNOT REPRESENTED A HUMAN LIFE
BUT SHE FAILED TO FIND THE COMFORT SHE SOUGHT FOR ANNOYANCES CONTINUED IN A MORE AGGRAVATED FORM
TWO MONTHS AFTER THIS INCIDENT THE SAME PERSECUTORS AGAIN ENTERED OUR HOME IN THE DEAD OF THE NIGHT AND AT THE POINT OF A PISTOL TRIED TO FORCE MY MOTHER TO SET FIRE TO HER OWN HOME
I HAVE ALWAYS FELT THAT THE EXPOSURE TO WHICH SHE WAS SUBJECTED ON THIS CRUEL JOURNEY TOO HARD EVEN FOR A MAN TO TAKE WAS THE DIRECT CAUSE OF HER DEATH
FROM HARRISONVILLE SHE WENT TO WAVERLY WHERE SHE WAS HOUNDED CONTINUALLY
ONE OF THE CONDITIONS UPON WHICH HER LIFE WAS SPARED WAS THAT SHE WOULD REPORT AT LEXINGTON WEEKLY
ONE OF MY OLD SCHOOL TEACHERS WHOM I HAVE NEVER SEEN SINCE THE SPRING OR SUMMER OF EIGHTEEN SIXTY TWO IS STEPHEN B ELKINS SENATOR FROM WEST VIRGINIA
WHEN I WAS TAKEN PRISONER I EXPECTED TO BE SHOT WITHOUT CEREMONY
ALTHOUGH EVERY BOOK PURPORTING TO NARRATE THE LIVES OF THE YOUNGER BROTHERS HAS TOLD OF THE LIBERTY ROBBERY AND IMPLIED THAT WE HAD A PART IN IT THE YOUNGERS WERE NOT SUSPECTED AT THAT TIME NOR FOR A LONG TIME AFTERWARD
IT WAS CLAIMED BY PEOPLE OF LIBERTY THAT THEY POSITIVELY RECOGNIZED AMONG THE ROBBERS OLL SHEPHERD RED MONKERS AND BUD PENCE WHO HAD SEEN SERVICE WITH QUANTRELL
THIS RAID WAS ACCOMPANIED BY BLOODSHED JUDGE MC LAIN THE BANKER BEING SHOT THOUGH NOT FATALLY
NO WARRANT WAS ISSUED FOR THE YOUNGERS BUT SUBSEQUENT HISTORIANS HAVE INFERENTIALLY AT LEAST ACCUSED US OF TAKING PART BUT AS I SAID BEFORE THERE IS NO TRUTH IN THE ACCUSATION
JUNE THIRD EIGHTEEN SEVENTY ONE OBOCOCK BROTHERS BANK AT CORYDON IOWA WAS ROBBED OF FORTY THOUSAND DOLLARS BY SEVEN MEN IN BROAD DAYLIGHT
IT WAS CHARGED THAT ARTHUR MC COY OR A C MC COY AND MYSELF HAD BEEN PARTICIPANTS IN THE GAD'S HILL AFFAIR AND THE TWO STAGE ROBBERIES
THE PARTS OF THIS LETTER NOW RELEVANT ARE AS FOLLOWS
YOU MAY USE THIS LETTER IN YOUR OWN WAY
I WILL GIVE YOU THIS OUTLINE AND SKETCH OF MY WHEREABOUTS AND ACTIONS AT THE TIME OF CERTAIN ROBBERIES WITH WHICH I AM CHARGED
AT THE TIME OF THE GALLATIN BANK ROBBERY I WAS GATHERING CATTLE IN ELLIS COUNTY TEXAS CATTLE THAT I BOUGHT FROM PLEAS TAYLOR AND RECTOR
THIS CAN BE PROVED BY BOTH OF THEM ALSO BY SHERIFF BARKLEY AND FIFTY OTHER RESPECTABLE MEN OF THAT COUNTY
I BROUGHT THE CATTLE TO KANSAS THAT FALL AND REMAINED IN SAINT CLAIR COUNTY UNTIL FEBRUARY
I THEN WENT TO ARKANSAS AND RETURNED TO SAINT CLAIR COUNTY ABOUT THE FIRST OF MAY
I WENT TO KANSAS WHERE OUR CATTLE WERE IN WOODSON COUNTY AT COLONEL RIDGE'S
DURING THE SUMMER I WAS EITHER IN SAINT CLAIR JACKSON OR KANSAS BUT AS THERE WAS NO ROBBERY COMMITTED THAT SUMMER IT MAKES NO DIFFERENCE WHERE I WAS
I WENT THROUGH INDEPENDENCE AND FROM THERE TO ACE WEBB'S
THERE I TOOK DINNER AND THEN WENT TO DOCTOR L W TWYMAN'S
OUR BUSINESS THERE WAS TO SEE E P WEST HE WAS NOT AT HOME BUT THE FAMILY WILL REMEMBER THAT WE WERE THERE
WE CROSSED ON THE BRIDGE STAYED IN THE CITY ALL NIGHT AND THE NEXT MORNING WE RODE UP THROUGH THE CITY
I MET SEVERAL OF MY FRIENDS AMONG THEM WAS BOB HUDSPETH
WE WERE NOT ON GOOD TERMS AT THE TIME NOR HAVE WE BEEN FOR SEVERAL YEARS
POOR JOHN HE HAS BEEN HUNTED DOWN AND SHOT LIKE A WILD BEAST AND NEVER WAS A BOY MORE INNOCENT
DOCTOR L LEWIS WAS HIS PHYSICIAN
THERE WERE FIFTY OR A HUNDRED PERSONS THERE WHO WILL TESTIFY IN ANY COURT THAT JOHN AND I WERE THERE
HELVIN FICKLE AND WIFE OF GREENTON VALLEY WERE ATTENDING THE SPRINGS AT THAT TIME AND EITHER OF THEM WILL TESTIFY TO THE ABOVE FOR JOHN AND I SAT IN FRONT OF MISTER SMITH WHILE HE WAS PREACHING AND WAS IN HIS COMPANY FOR A FEW MOMENTS TOGETHER WITH HIS WIFE AND MISTER AND MISSUS FICKLE AFTER SERVICE
ABOUT THE LAST OF DECEMBER EIGHTEEN SEVENTY THREE I ARRIVED IN CARROLL PARISH LOUISIANA
I STAYED THERE UNTIL THE EIGHTH OF FEBRUARY EIGHTEEN SEVENTY FOUR
I HAD NOT HEARD OF THAT WHEN I WROTE THE LETTER OF EIGHTEEN SEVENTY FOUR AND TO CORRECT ANY MISAPPREHENSION THAT MIGHT BE CREATED BY OMITTING IT I WILL SAY THAT AT THAT TIME I WAS AT NEOSHO KANSAS WITH A DROVE OF CATTLE WHICH I SOLD TO MAJOR RAY
IT WAS IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING THE ROCK ISLAND ROBBERY AT ADAIR IOWA THAT THERE FIRST APPEARED A DELIBERATE ENLISTMENT OF SOME LOCAL PAPERS IN MISSOURI TO CONNECT US WITH THIS ROBBERY
WE TOOK THE OATH PERHAPS THREE HUNDRED OF US DOWN ON LUTHER MASON'S FARM A FEW MILES FROM WHERE I NOW WRITE WHERE COLONEL HAYS HAD ENCAMPED AFTER INDEPENDENCE
BOONE MUIR AND MYSELF MET COFFEE AND THE REST BELOW ROSE HILL ON GRAND RIVER
ACCORDINGLY I WAS SHORTLY AWAKENED TO ACCOMPANY HIM TO LONE JACK WHERE HE WOULD PERSONALLY MAKE KNOWN THE SITUATION TO THE OTHER COLONELS
FOSTER HAD NEARLY ONE THOUSAND CAVALRYMEN AND TWO PIECES OF RABB'S INDIANA BATTERY THAT HAD ALREADY MADE FOR ITSELF A NAME FOR HARD FIGHTING
COME IN COLONEL HAYS EXCLAIMED COLONEL COCKRELL
I THINK HE'LL BE RATHER TOUGH MEAT FOR BREAKFAST I REPLIED HE MIGHT BE ALL RIGHT FOR DINNER
JACKMAN WITH A PARTY OF THIRTY SEASONED MEN CHARGED THE INDIANA GUNS AND CAPTURED THEM BUT MAJOR FOSTER LED A GALLANT CHARGE AGAINST THE INVADERS AND RECAPTURED THE PIECES
WE WERE OUT OF AMMUNITION AND WERE HELPLESS HAD THE FIGHT BEEN PRESSED
THEY DID MARK MY CLOTHES IN ONE OR TWO PLACES HOWEVER
MAJOR FOSTER IN A LETTER TO JUDGE GEORGE M BENNETT OF MINNEAPOLIS SAID
I WAS TOLD BY SOME OF OUR MEN FROM THE WESTERN BORDER OF THE STATE THAT THEY RECOGNIZED THE DARING YOUNG RIDER AS COLE YOUNGER
ABOUT NINE THIRTY A M I WAS SHOT DOWN
THE WOUNDED OF BOTH FORCES WERE GATHERED UP AND WERE PLACED IN HOUSES
THAT NIGHT IT STARTED TO RAIN AND WE WORE OUT OUR HORSES
FRIDAY WE MOVED TOWARD WATERVILLE AND FRIDAY NIGHT WE CAMPED BETWEEN ELYSIAN AND GERMAN LAKE
BOB'S SHATTERED ELBOW WAS REQUIRING FREQUENT ATTENTION AND THAT NIGHT WE MADE ONLY NINE MILES AND MONDAY MONDAY NIGHT AND TUESDAY WE SPENT IN A DESERTED FARM HOUSE CLOSE TO MANKATO
THAT DAY A MAN NAMED DUNNING DISCOVERED US AND WE TOOK HIM PRISONER
FINALLY WE ADMINISTERED TO HIM AN OATH NOT TO BETRAY OUR WHEREABOUTS UNTIL WE HAD TIME TO MAKE OUR ESCAPE AND HE AGREED NOT TO
NO SOONER HOWEVER WAS HE RELEASED THAN HE MADE POSTHASTE INTO MANKATO TO ANNOUNCE OUR PRESENCE AND IN A FEW MINUTES ANOTHER POSSE WAS LOOKING FOR US
THE WHISTLE ON THE OIL MILL BLEW AND WE FEARED THAT IT WAS A SIGNAL THAT HAD BEEN AGREED UPON TO ALARM THE TOWN IN CASE WE WERE OBSERVED BUT WE WERE NOT MOLESTED
HE HAD TO SLEEP WITH IT PILLOWED ON MY BREAST JIM BEING ALSO CRIPPLED WITH A WOUND IN HIS SHOULDER AND WE COULD NOT GET MUCH SLEEP
BUT THEY SOON AFTER GOT CLOSE ENOUGH SO THAT ONE OF THEM BROKE MY WALKING STICK WITH A SHOT
WE WERE IN SIGHT OF OUR LONG SOUGHT HORSES WHEN THEY CUT US OFF FROM THE ANIMALS AND OUR LAST HOPE WAS GONE
SIX STEPPED TO THE FRONT SHERIFF GLISPIN COLONEL T L VOUGHT B M RICE G A BRADFORD C A POMEROY AND S J SEVERSON
FORMING IN LINE FOUR PACES APART HE ORDERED THEM TO ADVANCE RAPIDLY AND CONCENTRATE THE FIRE OF THE WHOLE LINE THE INSTANT THE ROBBERS WERE DISCOVERED
MAKE FOR THE HORSES I SAID EVERY MAN FOR HIMSELF
THERE IS NO USE STOPPING TO PICK UP A COMRADE HERE FOR WE CAN'T GET HIM THROUGH THE LINE JUST CHARGE THEM AND MAKE IT IF WE CAN
I GOT UP AS THE SIGNAL FOR THE CHARGE AND WE FIRED ONE VOLLEY
ONE OF THE FELLOWS IN THE OUTER LINE NOT BRAVE ENOUGH HIMSELF TO JOIN THE VOLUNTEERS WHO HAD COME IN TO BEAT US OUT WAS NOT DISPOSED TO BELIEVE IN THE SURRENDER AND HAD HIS GUN LEVELLED ON BOB IN SPITE OF THE HANDKERCHIEF WHICH WAS WAVING AS A FLAG OF TRUCE
SHERIFF GLISPIN OF WATONWAN COUNTY WHO WAS TAKING BOB'S PISTOL FROM HIM WAS ALSO SHOUTING TO THE FELLOW
INCLUDING THOSE RECEIVED IN AND ON THE WAY FROM NORTHFIELD I HAD ELEVEN WOUNDS
AND SHERIFF GLISPIN'S ORDER NOT TO SHOOT WAS THE BEGINNING OF THE PROTECTORATE THAT MINNESOTA PEOPLE ESTABLISHED OVER US
I URGED ON THE BOYS THAT WHATEVER HAPPENED WE SHOULD NOT SHOOT ANY ONE
WHEN MILLER AND I CROSSED THE BRIDGE THE THREE WERE ON SOME DRY GOODS BOXES AT THE CORNER NEAR THE BANK AND AS SOON AS THEY SAW US WENT RIGHT INTO THE BANK INSTEAD OF WAITING FOR US TO GET THERE
WHEN WE CAME UP I TOLD MILLER TO SHUT THE BANK DOOR WHICH THEY HAD LEFT OPEN IN THEIR HURRY
J S ALLEN WHOSE HARDWARE STORE WAS NEAR TRIED TO GO INTO THE BANK BUT MILLER ORDERED HIM AWAY AND HE RAN AROUND THE CORNER SHOUTING
GET YOUR GUNS BOYS THEY'RE ROBBING THE BANK
AND I CALLED TO HIM TO GET INSIDE AT THE SAME TIME FIRING A PISTOL SHOT IN THE AIR AS A SIGNAL TO THE THREE BOYS AT THE BRIDGE THAT WE HAD BEEN DISCOVERED
ALMOST AT THIS INSTANT I HEARD A PISTOL SHOT IN THE BANK
CHADWELL WOODS AND JIM RODE UP AND JOINED US SHOUTING TO PEOPLE IN THE STREET TO GET INSIDE AND FIRING THEIR PISTOLS TO EMPHASIZE THEIR COMMANDS
IF ANY OF OUR PARTY SHOT HIM IT MUST HAVE BEEN WOODS
MEANTIME THE STREET WAS GETTING UNCOMFORTABLY HOT
EVERY TIME I SAW ANY ONE WITH A BEAD ON ME I WOULD DROP OFF MY HORSE AND TRY TO DRIVE THE SHOOTER INSIDE BUT I COULD NOT SEE IN EVERY DIRECTION
DOCTOR WHEELER WHO HAD GONE UPSTAIRS IN THE HOTEL SHOT MILLER AND HE LAY DYING IN THE STREET
CHANGING HIS PISTOL TO HIS LEFT HAND BOB RAN OUT AND MOUNTED MILLER'S MARE
WHAT KEPT YOU SO LONG I ASKED PITTS
AS TO THE REST OF THE AFFAIR INSIDE THE BANK I TAKE THE ACCOUNT OF A NORTHFIELD NARRATOR
WHERE'S THE MONEY OUTSIDE THE SAFE BOB ASKED
THE SHUTTERS WERE CLOSED AND THIS CAUSED BUNKER AN INSTANT'S DELAY THAT WAS ALMOST FATAL PITTS CHASED HIM WITH A BULLET
THE FIRST ONE MISSED HIM BUT THE SECOND WENT THROUGH HIS RIGHT SHOULDER
THEY SWARMED UP IN FRONT OF SHERBURN'S PALINGS AS THICK AS THEY COULD JAM TOGETHER AND YOU COULDN'T HEAR YOURSELF THINK FOR THE NOISE
SOME SUNG OUT TEAR DOWN THE FENCE TEAR DOWN THE FENCE
THE STILLNESS WAS AWFUL CREEPY AND UNCOMFORTABLE
SHERBURN RUN HIS EYE SLOW ALONG THE CROWD AND WHEREVER IT STRUCK THE PEOPLE TRIED A LITTLE TO OUT GAZE HIM BUT THEY COULDN'T THEY DROPPED THEIR EYES AND LOOKED SNEAKY
THE AVERAGE MAN'S A COWARD
BECAUSE THEY'RE AFRAID THE MAN'S FRIENDS WILL SHOOT THEM IN THE BACK IN THE DARKAND IT'S JUST WHAT THEY WOULD DO
SO THEY ALWAYS ACQUIT AND THEN A MAN GOES IN THE NIGHT WITH A HUNDRED MASKED COWARDS AT HIS BACK AND LYNCHES THE RASCAL
YOU DIDN'T WANT TO COME
BUT A MOB WITHOUT ANY MAN AT THE HEAD OF IT IS BENEATH PITIFULNESS
NOW LEAVE AND TAKE YOUR HALF A MAN WITH YOU TOSSING HIS GUN UP ACROSS HIS LEFT ARM AND COCKING IT WHEN HE SAYS THIS
THE CROWD WASHED BACK SUDDEN AND THEN BROKE ALL APART AND WENT TEARING OFF EVERY WHICH WAY AND BUCK HARKNESS HE HEELED IT AFTER THEM LOOKING TOLERABLE CHEAP
YOU CAN'T BE TOO CAREFUL
THEY ARGUED AND TRIED TO KEEP HIM OUT BUT HE WOULDN'T LISTEN AND THE WHOLE SHOW COME TO A STANDSTILL
AND ONE OR TWO WOMEN BEGUN TO SCREAM
SO THEN THE RINGMASTER HE MADE A LITTLE SPEECH AND SAID HE HOPED THERE WOULDN'T BE NO DISTURBANCE AND IF THE MAN WOULD PROMISE HE WOULDN'T MAKE NO MORE TROUBLE HE WOULD LET HIM RIDE IF HE THOUGHT HE COULD STAY ON THE HORSE
IT WARN'T FUNNY TO ME THOUGH I WAS ALL OF A TREMBLE TO SEE HIS DANGER
AND THE HORSE A GOING LIKE A HOUSE AFIRE TOO
HE SHED THEM SO THICK THEY KIND OF CLOGGED UP THE AIR AND ALTOGETHER HE SHED SEVENTEEN SUITS
WHY IT WAS ONE OF HIS OWN MEN
WHICH WAS SOUND ENOUGH JUDGMENT BUT YOU TAKE THE AVERAGE MAN AND HE WOULDN'T WAIT FOR HIM TO HOWL
THE KING'S DUDS WAS ALL BLACK AND HE DID LOOK REAL SWELL AND STARCHY
WHY BEFORE HE LOOKED LIKE THE ORNERIEST OLD RIP THAT EVER WAS BUT NOW WHEN HE'D TAKE OFF HIS NEW WHITE BEAVER AND MAKE A BOW AND DO A SMILE HE LOOKED THAT GRAND AND GOOD AND PIOUS THAT YOU'D SAY HE HAD WALKED RIGHT OUT OF THE ARK AND MAYBE WAS OLD LEVITICUS HIMSELF
JIM CLEANED UP THE CANOE AND I GOT MY PADDLE READY
WHER YOU BOUND FOR YOUNG MAN
GIT ABOARD SAYS THE KING
I DONE SO AND THEN WE ALL THREE STARTED ON AGAIN
THE YOUNG CHAP WAS MIGHTY THANKFUL SAID IT WAS TOUGH WORK TOTING HIS BAGGAGE SUCH WEATHER
HE ASKED THE KING WHERE HE WAS GOING AND THE KING TOLD HIM HE'D COME DOWN THE RIVER AND LANDED AT THE OTHER VILLAGE THIS MORNING AND NOW HE WAS GOING UP A FEW MILE TO SEE AN OLD FRIEND ON A FARM UP THERE THE YOUNG FELLOW SAYS
BUT THEN I SAYS AGAIN NO I RECKON IT AIN'T HIM OR ELSE HE WOULDN'T BE PADDLING UP THE RIVER YOU AIN'T HIM ARE YOU
NO MY NAME'S BLODGETT ELEXANDER BLODGETT REVEREND ELEXANDER BLODGETT I S'POSE I MUST SAY AS I'M ONE O THE LORD'S POOR SERVANTS
YOU SEE HE WAS PRETTY OLD AND GEORGE'S G'YIRLS WAS TOO YOUNG TO BE MUCH COMPANY FOR HIM EXCEPT MARY JANE THE RED HEADED ONE AND SO HE WAS KINDER LONESOME AFTER GEORGE AND HIS WIFE DIED AND DIDN'T SEEM TO CARE MUCH TO LIVE
TOO BAD TOO BAD HE COULDN'T A LIVED TO SEE HIS BROTHERS POOR SOUL
I'M GOING IN A SHIP NEXT WEDNESDAY FOR RYO JANEERO WHERE MY UNCLE LIVES
BUT IT'LL BE LOVELY WISHT I WAS A GOING
MARY JANE'S NINETEEN SUSAN'S FIFTEEN AND JOANNA'S ABOUT FOURTEENTHAT'S THE ONE THAT GIVES HERSELF TO GOOD WORKS AND HAS A HARE LIP POOR THINGS
WELL THEY COULD BE WORSE OFF
OLD PETER HAD FRIENDS AND THEY AIN'T GOING TO LET THEM COME TO NO HARM
BLAMED IF HE DIDN'T INQUIRE ABOUT EVERYBODY AND EVERYTHING IN THAT BLESSED TOWN AND ALL ABOUT THE WILKSES AND ABOUT PETER'S BUSINESSWHICH WAS A TANNER AND ABOUT GEORGE'SWHICH WAS A CARPENTER AND ABOUT HARVEY'SWHICH WAS A DISSENTERING MINISTER AND SO ON AND SO ON THEN HE SAYS
WHEN THEY'RE DEEP THEY WON'T STOP FOR A HAIL
WAS PETER WILKS WELL OFF
WHEN WE STRUCK THE BOAT SHE WAS ABOUT DONE LOADING AND PRETTY SOON SHE GOT OFF
NOW HUSTLE BACK RIGHT OFF AND FETCH THE DUKE UP HERE AND THE NEW CARPET BAGS
SO THEN THEY WAITED FOR A STEAMBOAT
BUT THE KING WAS CA'M HE SAYS
THEY GIVE A GLANCE AT ONE ANOTHER AND NODDED THEIR HEADS AS MUCH AS TO SAY WHAT D I TELL YOU
THEN ONE OF THEM SAYS KIND OF SOFT AND GENTLE
PHELPS WAS ONE OF THESE LITTLE ONE HORSE COTTON PLANTATIONS AND THEY ALL LOOK ALIKE
I WENT AROUND AND CLUMB OVER THE BACK STILE BY THE ASH HOPPER AND STARTED FOR THE KITCHEN
I OUT WITH A YES'M BEFORE I THOUGHT
SO THEN SHE STARTED FOR THE HOUSE LEADING ME BY THE HAND AND THE CHILDREN TAGGING AFTER
WHEN WE GOT THERE SHE SET ME DOWN IN A SPLIT BOTTOMED CHAIR AND SET HERSELF DOWN ON A LITTLE LOW STOOL IN FRONT OF ME HOLDING BOTH OF MY HANDS AND SAYS
WELL IT'S LUCKY BECAUSE SOMETIMES PEOPLE DO GET HURT
AND I THINK HE DIED AFTERWARDS HE WAS A BAPTIST
YES IT WAS MORTIFICATIONTHAT WAS IT
YOUR UNCLE'S BEEN UP TO THE TOWN EVERY DAY TO FETCH YOU
YOU MUST A MET HIM ON THE ROAD DIDN'T YOU OLDISH MAN WITH A
WHY CHILD IT LL BE STOLE
IT WAS KINDER THIN ICE BUT I SAYS
I HAD MY MIND ON THE CHILDREN ALL THE TIME I WANTED TO GET THEM OUT TO ONE SIDE AND PUMP THEM A LITTLE AND FIND OUT WHO I WAS
PRETTY SOON SHE MADE THE COLD CHILLS STREAK ALL DOWN MY BACK BECAUSE SHE SAYS
I SEE IT WARN'T A BIT OF USE TO TRY TO GO AHEAD I'D GOT TO THROW UP MY HAND
SO I SAYS TO MYSELF HERE'S ANOTHER PLACE WHERE I GOT TO RESK THE TRUTH
I OPENED MY MOUTH TO BEGIN BUT SHE GRABBED ME AND HUSTLED ME IN BEHIND THE BED AND SAYS HERE HE COMES
CHILDREN DON'T YOU SAY A WORD
I SEE I WAS IN A FIX NOW
MISSUS PHELPS SHE JUMPS FOR HIM AND SAYS
HAS HE COME NO SAYS HER HUSBAND
I CAN'T IMAGINE SAYS THE OLD GENTLEMAN AND I MUST SAY IT MAKES ME DREADFUL UNEASY
UNEASY SHE SAYS I'M READY TO GO DISTRACTED
HE MUST A COME AND YOU'VE MISSED HIM ALONG THE ROAD
OH DON'T DISTRESS ME ANY MORE'N I'M ALREADY DISTRESSED
WHY SILAS LOOK YONDER UP THE ROAD AIN'T THAT SOMEBODY COMING
THE OLD GENTLEMAN STARED AND SAYS
I HAIN'T NO IDEA WHO IS IT
IT'S TOM SAWYER
BEING TOM SAWYER WAS EASY AND COMFORTABLE AND IT STAYED EASY AND COMFORTABLE TILL BY AND BY I HEAR A STEAMBOAT COUGHING ALONG DOWN THE RIVER
THEN I SAYS TO MYSELF S'POSE TOM SAWYER COMES DOWN ON THAT BOAT
ANDBUT NEVER MIND THE REST OF HIS OUTFIT IT WAS JUST WILD BUT IT WAS AWFUL FUNNY
THE PEOPLE MOST KILLED THEMSELVES LAUGHING AND WHEN THE KING GOT DONE CAPERING AND CAPERED OFF BEHIND THE SCENES THEY ROARED AND CLAPPED AND STORMED AND HAW HAWED TILL HE COME BACK AND DONE IT OVER AGAIN AND AFTER THAT THEY MADE HIM DO IT ANOTHER TIME
TWENTY PEOPLE SINGS OUT
THE DUKE SAYS YES
EVERYBODY SINGS OUT SOLD
BUT A BIG FINE LOOKING MAN JUMPS UP ON A BENCH AND SHOUTS HOLD ON
JUST A WORD GENTLEMEN THEY STOPPED TO LISTEN
WHAT WE WANT IS TO GO OUT OF HERE QUIET AND TALK THIS SHOW UP AND SELL THE REST OF THE TOWN
YOU BET IT IS THE JEDGE IS RIGHT EVERYBODY SINGS OUT
WE STRUCK THE RAFT AT THE SAME TIME AND IN LESS THAN TWO SECONDS WE WAS GLIDING DOWN STREAM ALL DARK AND STILL AND EDGING TOWARDS THE MIDDLE OF THE RIVER NOBODY SAYING A WORD
WE NEVER SHOWED A LIGHT TILL WE WAS ABOUT TEN MILE BELOW THE VILLAGE
GREENHORNS FLATHEADS
NO I SAYS IT DON'T
WELL IT DON'T BECAUSE IT'S IN THE BREED I RECKON THEY'RE ALL ALIKE
WELL THAT'S WHAT I'M A SAYING ALL KINGS IS MOSTLY RAPSCALLIONS AS FUR AS I CAN MAKE OUT IS DAT SO
AND LOOK AT CHARLES SECOND AND LOUIS FOURTEEN AND LOUIS FIFTEEN AND JAMES SECOND AND EDWARD SECOND AND RICHARD THIRD AND FORTY MORE BESIDES ALL THEM SAXON HEPTARCHIES THAT USED TO RIP AROUND SO IN OLD TIMES AND RAISE CAIN
MY YOU OUGHT TO SEEN OLD HENRY THE EIGHT WHEN HE WAS IN BLOOM HE WAS A BLOSSOM
RING UP FAIR ROSAMUN
WELL HENRY HE TAKES A NOTION HE WANTS TO GET UP SOME TROUBLE WITH THIS COUNTRY
S'POSE HE OPENED HIS MOUTHWHAT THEN
ALL I SAY IS KINGS IS KINGS AND YOU GOT TO MAKE ALLOWANCES
TAKE THEM ALL AROUND THEY'RE A MIGHTY ORNERY LOT IT'S THE WAY THEY'RE RAISED
WELL THEY ALL DO JIM
NOW DE DUKE HE'S A TOLERBLE LIKELY MAN IN SOME WAYS
THIS ONE'S A MIDDLING HARD LOT FOR A DUKE
WHEN I WAKED UP JUST AT DAYBREAK HE WAS SITTING THERE WITH HIS HEAD DOWN BETWIXT HIS KNEES MOANING AND MOURNING TO HIMSELF
IT DON'T SEEM NATURAL BUT I RECKON IT'S SO
HE WAS OFTEN MOANING AND MOURNING THAT WAY NIGHTS WHEN HE JUDGED I WAS ASLEEP AND SAYING PO LITTLE LIZABETH
DOAN YOU HEAR ME SHET DE DO
I LAY I MAKE YOU MINE
JIS AS LOUD AS I COULD YELL
EVEN THE SUN CAME OUT PALE AND WATERY AT NOON
THE COLDS AND RHEUMATISM OF THE RAINY MONTHS VANISHED
ASKED A WORKER LAST SUNDAY YOU DID IT WHEN THE YUNKERS
WELL DIDN'T THEY SHOOT US ONE MAN EXHIBITED HIS ARM IN A SLING
HAVEN'T I GOT SOMETHING TO REMEMBER THEM BY THE DEVILS
WHO ARE YOU TO DESTROY THE LEGAL GOVERNMENT WHO IS LENIN A GERMAN
WHO ARE YOU A COUNTER REVOLUTIONIST A PROVOCATOR THEY BELLOWED AT HIM
YOU CALL YOURSELVES THE PEOPLE OF RUSSIA BUT YOU'RE NOT THE PEOPLE OF RUSSIA
THE PEASANTS ARE THE PEOPLE OF RUSSIA WAIT UNTIL THE PEASANTS
WE KNOW WHAT THE PEASANTS WILL SAY AREN'T THEY WORKINGMEN LIKE OURSELVES
THESE MEN ESPECIALLY WELCOMED THE CALL TO A CONGRESS OF PEASANTS
THESE LAST WERE THE YOUNG GENERATION WHO HAD BEEN SERVING IN THE ARMY
WHEREUPON THE OLD EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE LEFT THE HALL
DOWN WITH HIM THEY SHRIEKED
FEARFUL TUMULT CRIES DOWN WITH THE BOLSHEVIKI
UPON MY RETURN I VISITED SMOLNY NO SUCH ACCUSATION WAS MADE AGAINST ME THERE AFTER A BRIEF CONVERSATION I LEFT AND THAT'S ALL LET ANY ONE PRESENT MAKE SUCH AN ACCUSATION
MEANWHILE THE QUESTION OF THE STATUS OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE WAS AGITATING ALL MINDS
BY DECLARING THE ASSEMBLY EXTRAORDINARY CONFERENCE IT HAD BEEN PLANNED TO BLOCK THE REELECTION OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE
BUT THIS WORKED BOTH WAYS THE LEFT SOCIALIST REVOLUTIONISTS DECIDED THAT IF THE CONGRESS HAD NO POWER OVER THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE THEN THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE HAD NO POWER OVER THE CONGRESS
ON THE TWENTY SEVENTH OCCURRED THE DEBATE ON THE LAND QUESTION WHICH REVEALED THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE AGRARIAN PROGRAMME OF THE BOLSHEVIKI AND THE LEFT SOCIALIST REVOLUTIONARIES
THE CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY WILL NOT DARE TO BREAK WITH THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE
FOLLOWED HIM LENIN LISTENED TO NOW WITH ABSORBING INTENSITY
THE FIRST STAGE WAS THE CRUSHING OF AUTOCRACY AND THE CRUSHING OF THE POWER OF THE INDUSTRIAL CAPITALISTS AND LAND OWNERS WHOSE INTERESTS ARE CLOSELY RELATED
THE DUMAS AND ZEMSTVOS WERE DROPPED
HE KNEW THAT AN AGREEMENT WITH THE BOLSHEVIKI WAS BEING DISCUSSED BUT HE DID NOT KNOW THAT IT HAD BEEN CONCLUDED
HE SPOKE TO THE RUMP CONVENTION
THE VILLAGES WILL SAVE US IN THE END
BUT THE PRESENT MOVEMENT IS INTERNATIONAL AND THAT IS WHY IT IS INVINCIBLE
THE WILL OF MILLIONS OF WORKERS IS NOW CONCENTRATED IN THIS HALL
A NEW HUMANITY WILL BE BORN OF THIS WAR
I GREET YOU WITH THE CHRISTENING OF A NEW RUSSIAN LIFE AND FREEDOM
THERE WAS A MAN COMING FROM EARTH ON A SECOND SHIP WHO WOULD SEE HIM
THE LITTLE PUBLISHER WAS BACK AT THE CRUSADER AGAIN
ONLY GORDON AND SHEILA WERE LEFT
CREDIT HAD BEEN ESTABLISHED AGAIN AND THE BUSINESSES WERE OPEN
GORDON CAME TO A ROW OF TEMPORARY BUBBLES INDIVIDUAL DWELLINGS BUILT LIKE THE DOME BUT OPAQUE FOR PRIVACY
THEY HAD BEEN LUCKY
SCHULBERG'S VOLUNTEERS WERE OFFICIAL NOW
FATS PLACE WAS STILL OPEN THOUGH THE CROOKED TABLES HAD BEEN REMOVED GORDON DROPPED TO A STOOL SLIPPING OFF HIS HELMET
HE REACHED AUTOMATICALLY FOR THE GLASS OF ETHER NEEDLED BEER
THOUGHT YOU'D BE IN THE CHIPS
THAT'S MARS GORDON ECHOED THE OTHER'S COMMENT WHY DON'T YOU PULL OFF THE PLANET FATS YOU COULD GO BACK TO EARTH I'D GUESS THE OTHER NODDED
GUESS A MAN GETS USED TO ANYTHING HELL MAYBE I CAN HIRE SOME BUMS TO SIT AROUND AND WHOOP IT UP WHEN THE SHIPS COME IN AND BILL THIS AS A REAL OLD MARTIAN DEN OF SIN
THERE WAS A GRIN ON THE OTHER'S FACE
FINALLY GOT OUR ORDERS FOR YOU IT'S MERCURY
WE SENT TWENTY OTHERS THE SAME WAY AND THEY FAILED
LET'S SAY YOU'VE SHIFTED SOME OF THE MISERY AROUND A BIT AND GIVEN THEM A CHANCE TO DO BETTER
YOU CAN'T STAY HERE
THERE'S A ROCKET WAITING TO TRANSSHIP YOU TO THE MOON ON THE WAY TO MERCURY RIGHT NOW GORDON SIGHED
AND I'VE PAID HER THE PAY WE OWE YOU FROM THE TIME YOU BEGAN USING YOUR BADGE SHE'S OUT SHOPPING
BUT HIS OLD EYES WERE GLINTING
DID YOU THINK WE'D LET YOU GO WITHOUT SEEING YOU OFF COBBER HE ASKED
I I OH DRAT IT I'M GETTING OLD IZZY YOU TELL HIM
HE GRABBED GORDON'S HAND AND WADDLED DOWN THE LANDING PLANK IZZY SHOOK HIS HEAD
IT WAS NIGHT OUTSIDE AND THE PHOSPHOR BULBS AT THE CORNERS GLOWED DIMLY GIVING HIM BARELY ENOUGH LIGHT BY WHICH TO LOCATE THE WAY TO THE EXTEMPORIZED PRECINCT HOUSE
IT HAD PROBABLY BEEN YEARS SINCE ANY HAD DARED RISK IT AFTER THE SUN WENT DOWN
AND THE SLOW DOUBTFUL RESPECT ON THE FACES OF THE CITIZENS AS THEY NODDED TO HIM WAS EVEN MORE PROOF THAT HALEY'S SYSTEM WAS WORKING
GORDON HIT THE SIGNAL SWITCH AND THE MARSPEAKER LET OUT A SHRILL WHISTLE
GUNS SUDDENLY SEEMED TO BE FLOURISHING EVERYWHERE
YOU CAN'T DO IT TO ME
I'M REFORMED I'M GOING STRAIGHT
YOU DAMNED COPS CAN'T O'NEILL WAS BLUBBERING
ONE LOOK WAS ENOUGH THE WORK PAPERS HAD THE TELLTALE OVER THICKENING OF THE SIGNATURE THAT HAD SHOWED UP ON OTHER PAPERS OBVIOUSLY FORGERIES
SOME TURNED AWAY AS GORDON AND THE OTHER COP WENT TO WORK BUT MOST OF THEM WEREN'T SQUEAMISH
WHEN IT WAS OVER THE TWO PICKED UP THEIR WHIMPERING CAPTIVE
JENKINS THE OTHER COP HAD BEEN HOLDING THE WALLET
MUST OF BEEN MAKING A BIG CONTACT IN SOMETHING FIFTY FIFTY
THERE MUST HAVE BEEN OVER TWO THOUSAND CREDITS IN THE WALLET
WHEN GORDON AND JENKINS CAME BACK MURDOCH TOSSED THE MONEY TO THEM SPLIT IT
WHATEVER COMES TO HAND GOV'NOR
LIKE THIS SOCIAL CALL GORDON ASKED HIM
THE LITTLE MAN SHOOK HIS HEAD HIS ANCIENT EIGHTEEN YEAR OLD FACE TURNING SOBER NOPE
YOU OWE ME SOME BILLS GOV'NOR
ELEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY CREDITS
YOU DIDN'T PAY UP YOUR PLEDGE TO THE CAMPAIGN FUND SO I HADDA FILL IN
A THOUSAND INTEREST AT TEN PER CENT A WEEK STANDARD RIGHT
GORDON HAD HEARD OF THE FRIENDLY INTEREST CHARGED ON THE SIDE HERE BUT HE SHOOK HIS HEAD WRONG IZZY
HUH IZZY TURNED IT OVER AND SHOOK HIS HEAD
NOW SHOW ME WHERE I SIGNED ANY AGREEMENT SAYING I'D PAY YOU BACK
FOR A SECOND IZZY'S FACE WENT BLANK THEN HE CHUCKLED
HE PULLED OUT THE BILLS AND HANDED THEM OVER
THANKS IZZY THANKS YOURSELF
THE KID POCKETED THE MONEY CHEERFULLY NODDING
THE LITTLE GUY KNEW MARS AS FEW OTHERS DID APPARENTLY FROM ALL SIDES
AND IF ANY OF THE OTHER COPS HAD PRIVATE RACKETS OF THEIR OWN IZZY WAS UNDOUBTEDLY THE MAN TO FIND IT OUT AND USE THE INFORMATION WITH A BEAT SUCH AS THAT EVEN GOING HALVES AND WITH ALL THE GRAFT TO THE UPPER BRACKETS HE'D STILL BE ABLE TO MAKE HIS PILE IN A MATTER OF MONTHS
THE CAPTAIN LOOKED COMPLETELY BEATEN AS HE CAME INTO THE ROOM AND DROPPED ONTO THE BENCH
GO ON ACCEPT DAMN IT
CAPTAIN MURDOCH
BUT MARSPORT HAD FLOURISHED ENOUGH TO KILL IT OFF
SOME OF MARS LAWS DATED FROM THE TIME WHEN LAW ENFORCEMENT HAD BEEN HAMPERED BY LACK OF MEN RATHER THAN BY THE TYPE OF MEN
THE STONEWALL GANG NUMBERED PERHAPS FIVE HUNDRED
EVEN DERELICTS AND FAILURES HAD TO EAT THERE WERE STORES AND SHOPS THROUGHOUT THE DISTRICT WHICH EKED OUT SOME KIND OF A MARGINAL LIVING
THEY WERE SAFE FROM PROTECTION RACKETEERS THERE NONE BOTHERED TO COME SO FAR OUT
THE SHOPKEEPERS AND SOME OF THE LESS UNFORTUNATE PEOPLE THERE HAD PROTESTED LOUD ENOUGH TO REACH CLEAR BACK TO EARTH
CAPTAIN MURDOCH WAS AN UNKNOWN FACTOR AND NOW WAS ASKING FOR MORE MEN
THE PRESSURE WAS ENOUGH TO GET THEM FOR HIM
GORDON REPORTED FOR WORK WITH A SENSE OF THE BOTTOM FALLING OUT MIXED WITH A VAGUE RELIEF
I'VE GOT A FREE HAND AND WE'RE GOING TO RUN THIS THE WAY WE WOULD ON EARTH
YOUR JOB IS TO PROTECT THE CITIZENS HERE AND THAT MEANS EVERYONE NOT BREAKING THE LAWS WHETHER YOU FEEL LIKE IT OR NOT NO GRAFT
THE FIRST MAN MAKING A SHAKEDOWN WILL GET THE SAME TREATMENT WE'RE GOING TO USE ON THE STONEWALL BOYS YOU'LL GET DOUBLE PAY HERE AND YOU CAN LIVE ON IT
HE PICKED OUT FIVE OF THE MEN INCLUDING GORDON YOU FIVE WILL COME WITH ME
THE REST OF YOU CAN TEAM UP ANY WAY YOU WANT TONIGHT PICK ANY ROUTE THAT'S OPEN OKAY MEN LET'S GO
BRUCE GORDON GRINNED SLOWLY AS HE SWUNG THE STICK AND MURDOCH'S EYES FELL ON HIM EARTH COP
TWO YEARS GORDON ADMITTED
FOR A SECOND GORDON CURSED HIMSELF
HE BEGAN WONDERING ABOUT SECURITY THEN
NOBODY HAD TRIED TO GET IN TOUCH WITH HIM
THERE WAS A CRUDE LIGHTING SYSTEM HERE PUT UP BY THE CITIZENS AT THE FRONT OF EACH BUILDING A DIM PHOSPHOR BULB GLOWED WHEN DARKNESS FELL THEY WOULD HAVE NOTHING ELSE TO SEE BY
MOVING IN TWO GROUPS OF THREES AT OPPOSITE SIDES OF THE STREET THEY BEGAN THEIR BEAT
THERE WAS NO CHANCE TO SAVE THE CITIZEN WHO WAS DYING FROM LACK OF AIR
GORDON FELT THE SOLID PLEASURE OF THE FINELY TURNED CLUB IN HIS HANDS
GORDON'S EYES POPPED AT THAT
HE SWALLOWED THE SENTIMENT HIS OWN CLUB WAS MOVING NOW
THE OTHER FOUR COPS HAD COME IN RELUCTANTLY
HE BROUGHT HIM TO THE GROUND WITH A SINGLE BLOW ACROSS THE KIDNEYS
THEY ROUNDED UP THE MEN OF THE GANG AND ONE OF THE COPS STARTED OFF
TO FIND A PHONE AND CALL THE WAGON
WE'RE NOT USING WAGONS MURDOCH TOLD HIM LINE THEM UP
IF THEY TRIED TO RUN THEY WERE HIT FROM BEHIND IF THEY STOOD STILL THEY WERE CLUBBED CAREFULLY
MURDOCH INDICATED ONE WHO STOOD WITH HIS SHOULDERS SHAKING AND TEARS RUNNING DOWN HIS CHEEKS
THE CAPTAIN'S FACE WAS AS SICK AS GORDON FELT
I WANT THE NAME OF EVERY MAN IN THE GANG YOU CAN REMEMBER HE TOLD THE MAN
COLONEL THEY'D KILL ME I DON'T KNOW
MURDOCH TOOK HIS NOD AS EVIDENCE ENOUGH AND TURNED TO THE WRETCHED TOUGHS
IF HE SHOULD TURN UP DEAD I'LL KNOW YOU BOYS ARE RESPONSIBLE AND I'LL FIND YOU
TROUBLE BEGAN BREWING SHORTLY AFTER THOUGH
MURDOCH SENT ONE OF THE MEN TO PICK UP A SECOND SQUAD OF SIX AND THEN A THIRD
IN THE THIRD ONE BRUCE GORDON SPOTTED ONE OF THE MEN WHO'D BEEN BEATEN BEFORE
GET A STRETCHER AND TAKE HIM WHEREVER HE BELONGS HE ORDERED
BUT THE CAPTAIN STIRRED FINALLY SIGHING
NO THE COPS THEY'RE GIVING ME WE'RE COVERED GORDON
BUT THE STONEWALL GANG IS BACKING WAYNE
BUT IT'S GOING TO BE TOUGH ON THEM
BRUCE GORDON GRIMACED I'VE GOT A YELLOW TICKET FROM SECURITY
MURDOCH BLINKED HE DROPPED HIS EYES SLOWLY
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK WAYNE WILL BE RE ELECTED
NOBODY WANTS HIM EXCEPT A GANG OF CROOKS AND THOSE IN POWER
EVER SEE A MARTIAN ELECTION
NO YOU'RE A FIRSTER HE CAN'T LOSE
AND THEN HELL IS GOING TO POP AND THIS WHOLE PLANET MAY BE BLOWN WIDE OPEN
IT FITTED WITH THE DIRE PREDICTIONS OF SECURITY AND WITH THE SPYING GORDON WAS GOING TO DO ACCORDING TO THEM
HE WAS GETTING EVEN FATTER NOW THAT HE WAS EATING BETTER FOOD FROM THE FAIR RESTAURANT AROUND THE CORNER
COST EM MORE BUT THEY'D BE RESPECTABLE
BECAUSE IZZY IS ALWAYS HONEST ACCORDING TO HOW HE SEES IT
BUT YOU GOT EARTH IDEAS OF THE STUFF LIKE I HAD ONCE
THE GROUPS GREW MORE EXPERIENCED AND MURDOCH WAS TRAINING A NEW SQUAD EVERY NIGHT
IT WASN'T EXACTLY LEGAL BUT NOTHING WAS HERE
THIS COULD LEAD TO ABUSES AS HE'D SEEN ON EARTH
BUT THERE PROBABLY WOULDN'T BE TIME FOR IT IF MAYOR WAYNE WAS RE ELECTED
CAPTAIN LAKE DID NOT LOOK AT ALL LIKE A LONDON DANDY NOW
THERE WAS A VERY NATURAL SAVAGERY AND DEJECTION THERE AND A WILD LEER IN HIS YELLOW EYES RACHEL SAT DOWN
A SLAVE ONLY THINK A SLAVE
OH FRIGHTFUL FRIGHTFUL IS IT A DREAM
OH FRIGHTFUL FRIGHTFUL
STANLEY STANLEY IT WOULD BE MERCY TO KILL ME SHE BROKE OUT AGAIN
BRIGHT AND NATTY WERE THE CHINTZ CURTAINS AND THE LITTLE TOILET SET OUT NOT INELEGANTLY AND HER PET PIPING GOLDFINCH ASLEEP ON HIS PERCH WITH HIS BIT OF SUGAR BETWEEN THE WIRES OF HIS CAGE HER PILLOW SO WHITE AND UNPRESSED WITH ITS LITTLE EDGING OF LACE
WHEN HE CAME BACK TO THE DRAWING ROOM A TOILET BOTTLE OF EAU DE COLOGNE IN HIS HAND WITH HER LACE HANDKERCHIEF HE BATHED HER TEMPLES AND FOREHEAD
THERE WAS NOTHING VERY BROTHERLY IN HIS LOOK AS HE PEERED INTO HER PALE SHARP FEATURES DURING THE PROCESS
THERE DON'T MIND ME SHE SAID SHARPLY AND GETTING UP SHE LOOKED DOWN AT HER DRESS AND THIN SHOES AND SEEMING TO RECOLLECT HERSELF SHE TOOK THE CANDLE HE HAD JUST SET DOWN AND WENT SWIFTLY TO HER ROOM
AND SHE THREW BACK HER VEIL AND GOING HURRIEDLY TO THE TOILET MECHANICALLY SURVEYED HERSELF IN THE GLASS
RACHEL LAKE RACHEL LAKE WHAT ARE YOU NOW
I'LL STAY HERE THAT IS IN THE DRAWING ROOM SHE ANSWERED AND THE FACE WAS WITHDRAWN
HE SLACKENED HIS PACE AND TAPPED SHARPLY AT THE LITTLE WINDOW OF THAT MODEST POST OFFICE AT WHICH THE YOUNG LADIES IN THE PONY CARRIAGE HAD PULLED UP THE DAY BEFORE AND WITHIN WHICH LUKE WAGGOT WAS WONT TO SLEEP IN A SORT OF WOODEN BOX THAT FOLDED UP AND APPEARED TO BE A CHEST OF DRAWERS ALL DAY
LUKE TOOK CARE OF MISTER LARKIN'S DOGS AND GROOMED MISTER WYLDER'S HORSE AND CLEANED UP HIS DOG CART FOR MARK BEING CLOSE ABOUT MONEY AND FINDING THAT THE THING WAS TO BE DONE MORE CHEAPLY THAT WAY PUT UP HIS HORSE AND DOG CART IN THE POST OFFICE PREMISES AND SO EVADED THE LIVERY CHARGES OF THE BRANDON ARMS
BUT LUKE WAS NOT THERE AND CAPTAIN LAKE RECOLLECTING HIS HABITS AND HIS HAUNT HURRIED ON TO THE SILVER LION WHICH HAS ITS GABLE TOWARDS THE COMMON ONLY ABOUT A HUNDRED STEPS AWAY FOR DISTANCES ARE NOT GREAT IN GYLINGDEN
HERE WERE THE FLOW OF SOUL AND OF STOUT LONG PIPES LONG YARNS AND TOLERABLY LONG CREDITS AND THE HUMBLE SCAPEGRACES OF THE TOWN RESORTED THITHER FOR THE PLEASURES OF A CLUB LIFE AND OFTEN REVELLED DEEP INTO THE SMALL HOURS OF THE MORNING
LOSE NO TIME AND I'LL GIVE YOU HALF A CROWN
LUKE STUCK ON HIS GREASY WIDEAWAKE AND IN A FEW MINUTES MORE THE DOG CART WAS TRUNDLED OUT INTO THE LANE AND THE HORSE HARNESSED WENT BETWEEN THE SHAFTS WITH THAT WONDERFUL CHEERFULNESS WITH WHICH THEY BEAR TO BE CALLED UP UNDER STARTLING CIRCUMSTANCES AT UNSEASONABLE HOURS
IF I THOUGHT YOU'D FAIL ME NOW TAMAR I SHOULD NEVER COME BACK GOOD NIGHT TAMAR
THE ACT SAID THAT IN CASE OF DIFFERENCE OF OPINION THERE MUST BE A BALLOT
HE WENT UP TO THE TABLE AND STRIKING IT WITH HIS FINGER RING HE SHOUTED LOUDLY A BALLOT
HE WAS SHOUTING FOR THE VERY COURSE SERGEY IVANOVITCH HAD PROPOSED BUT IT WAS EVIDENT THAT HE HATED HIM AND ALL HIS PARTY AND THIS FEELING OF HATRED SPREAD THROUGH THE WHOLE PARTY AND ROUSED IN OPPOSITION TO IT THE SAME VINDICTIVENESS THOUGH IN A MORE SEEMLY FORM ON THE OTHER SIDE
SHOUTS WERE RAISED AND FOR A MOMENT ALL WAS CONFUSION SO THAT THE MARSHAL OF THE PROVINCE HAD TO CALL FOR ORDER A BALLOT
WE SHED OUR BLOOD FOR OUR COUNTRY
THE CONFIDENCE OF THE MONARCH NO CHECKING THE ACCOUNTS OF THE MARSHAL HE'S NOT A CASHIER BUT THAT'S NOT THE POINT
VOTES PLEASE BEASTLY
THEY EXPRESSED THE MOST IMPLACABLE HATRED
LEVIN DID NOT IN THE LEAST UNDERSTAND WHAT WAS THE MATTER AND HE MARVELED AT THE PASSION WITH WHICH IT WAS DISPUTED WHETHER OR NOT THE DECISION ABOUT FLEROV SHOULD BE PUT TO THE VOTE
HE FORGOT AS SERGEY IVANOVITCH EXPLAINED TO HIM AFTERWARDS THIS SYLLOGISM THAT IT WAS NECESSARY FOR THE PUBLIC GOOD TO GET RID OF THE MARSHAL OF THE PROVINCE THAT TO GET RID OF THE MARSHAL IT WAS NECESSARY TO HAVE A MAJORITY OF VOTES THAT TO GET A MAJORITY OF VOTES IT WAS NECESSARY TO SECURE FLEROV'S RIGHT TO VOTE THAT TO SECURE THE RECOGNITION OF FLEROV'S RIGHT TO VOTE THEY MUST DECIDE ON THE INTERPRETATION TO BE PUT ON THE ACT
BUT LEVIN FORGOT ALL THAT AND IT WAS PAINFUL TO HIM TO SEE ALL THESE EXCELLENT PERSONS FOR WHOM HE HAD A RESPECT IN SUCH AN UNPLEASANT AND VICIOUS STATE OF EXCITEMENT
TO ESCAPE FROM THIS PAINFUL FEELING HE WENT AWAY INTO THE OTHER ROOM WHERE THERE WAS NOBODY EXCEPT THE WAITERS AT THE REFRESHMENT BAR
HE PARTICULARLY LIKED THE WAY ONE GRAY WHISKERED WAITER WHO SHOWED HIS SCORN FOR THE OTHER YOUNGER ONES AND WAS JEERED AT BY THEM WAS TEACHING THEM HOW TO FOLD UP NAPKINS PROPERLY
LEVIN ADVANCED BUT UTTERLY FORGETTING WHAT HE WAS TO DO AND MUCH EMBARRASSED HE TURNED TO SERGEY IVANOVITCH WITH THE QUESTION WHERE AM I TO PUT IT
SERGEY IVANOVITCH FROWNED
THAT IS A MATTER FOR EACH MAN'S OWN DECISION HE SAID SEVERELY
HAVING PUT IT IN HE RECOLLECTED THAT HE OUGHT TO HAVE THRUST HIS LEFT HAND TOO AND SO HE THRUST IT IN THOUGH TOO LATE AND STILL MORE OVERCOME WITH CONFUSION HE BEAT A HASTY RETREAT INTO THE BACKGROUND
A HUNDRED AND TWENTY SIX FOR ADMISSION NINETY EIGHT AGAINST
SANG OUT THE VOICE OF THE SECRETARY WHO COULD NOT PRONOUNCE THE LETTER R
THEN THERE WAS A LAUGH A BUTTON AND TWO NUTS WERE FOUND IN THE BOX
BUT THE OLD PARTY DID NOT CONSIDER THEMSELVES CONQUERED
IN REPLY SNETKOV SPOKE OF THE TRUST THE NOBLEMEN OF THE PROVINCE HAD PLACED IN HIM THE AFFECTION THEY HAD SHOWN HIM WHICH HE DID NOT DESERVE AS HIS ONLY MERIT HAD BEEN HIS ATTACHMENT TO THE NOBILITY TO WHOM HE HAD DEVOTED TWELVE YEARS OF SERVICE
THIS EXPRESSION IN THE MARSHAL'S FACE WAS PARTICULARLY TOUCHING TO LEVIN BECAUSE ONLY THE DAY BEFORE HE HAD BEEN AT HIS HOUSE ABOUT HIS TRUSTEE BUSINESS AND HAD SEEN HIM IN ALL HIS GRANDEUR A KIND HEARTED FATHERLY MAN
IF THERE ARE MEN YOUNGER AND MORE DESERVING THAN I LET THEM SERVE
AND THE MARSHAL DISAPPEARED THROUGH A SIDE DOOR
THEY WERE TO PROCEED IMMEDIATELY TO THE ELECTION
TWO NOBLE GENTLEMEN WHO HAD A WEAKNESS FOR STRONG DRINK HAD BEEN MADE DRUNK BY THE PARTISANS OF SNETKOV AND A THIRD HAD BEEN ROBBED OF HIS UNIFORM
ON LEARNING THIS THE NEW PARTY HAD MADE HASTE DURING THE DISPUTE ABOUT FLEROV TO SEND SOME OF THEIR MEN IN A SLEDGE TO CLOTHE THE STRIPPED GENTLEMAN AND TO BRING ALONG ONE OF THE INTOXICATED TO THE MEETING
LEVIN DID NOT CARE TO EAT AND HE WAS NOT SMOKING HE DID NOT WANT TO JOIN HIS OWN FRIENDS THAT IS SERGEY IVANOVITCH STEPAN ARKADYEVITCH SVIAZHSKY AND THE REST BECAUSE VRONSKY IN HIS EQUERRY'S UNIFORM WAS STANDING WITH THEM IN EAGER CONVERSATION
HE WENT TO THE WINDOW AND SAT DOWN SCANNING THE GROUPS AND LISTENING TO WHAT WAS BEING SAID AROUND HIM
HE'S SUCH A BLACKGUARD
I HAVE TOLD HIM SO BUT IT MAKES NO DIFFERENCE ONLY THINK OF IT
THESE PERSONS WERE UNMISTAKABLY SEEKING A PLACE WHERE THEY COULD TALK WITHOUT BEING OVERHEARD
SHALL WE GO ON YOUR EXCELLENCY FINE CHAMPAGNE
LAST YEAR AT OUR DISTRICT MARSHAL NIKOLAY IVANOVITCH'S
OH STILL JUST THE SAME ALWAYS AT A LOSS THE LANDOWNER ANSWERED WITH A RESIGNED SMILE BUT WITH AN EXPRESSION OF SERENITY AND CONVICTION THAT SO IT MUST BE
WHY WHAT IS THERE TO UNDERSTAND
THERE'S NO MEANING IN IT AT ALL
THEN TOO ONE MUST KEEP UP CONNECTIONS
IT'S A MORAL OBLIGATION OF A SORT
AND THEN TO TELL THE TRUTH THERE'S ONE'S OWN INTERESTS
THEY'RE PROPRIETORS OF A SORT BUT WE'RE THE LANDOWNERS
THAT IT MAY BE BUT STILL IT OUGHT TO BE TREATED A LITTLE MORE RESPECTFULLY
IF WE'RE LAYING OUT A GARDEN PLANNING ONE BEFORE THE HOUSE YOU KNOW AND THERE YOU'VE A TREE THAT'S STOOD FOR CENTURIES IN THE VERY SPOT OLD AND GNARLED IT MAY BE AND YET YOU DON'T CUT DOWN THE OLD FELLOW TO MAKE ROOM FOR THE FLOWERBEDS BUT LAY OUT YOUR BEDS SO AS TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE TREE
WELL AND HOW IS YOUR LAND DOING
BUT ONE'S WORK IS THROWN IN FOR NOTHING
OH WELL ONE DOES IT WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE
AND WHAT'S MORE THE LANDOWNER WENT ON LEANING HIS ELBOWS ON THE WINDOW AND CHATTING ON MY SON I MUST TELL YOU HAS NO TASTE FOR IT
SO THERE'LL BE NO ONE TO KEEP IT UP AND YET ONE DOES IT
WE WALKED ABOUT THE FIELDS AND THE GARDEN NO SAID HE STEPAN VASSILIEVITCH EVERYTHING'S WELL LOOKED AFTER BUT YOUR GARDEN'S NEGLECTED
TO MY THINKING I'D CUT DOWN THAT LIME TREE
HERE YOU'VE THOUSANDS OF LIMES AND EACH WOULD MAKE TWO GOOD BUNDLES OF BARK
YOU'RE MARRIED I'VE HEARD SAID THE LANDOWNER
YES IT'S RATHER STRANGE HE WENT ON
THE LANDOWNER CHUCKLED UNDER HIS WHITE MUSTACHES
WHY DON'T WE CUT DOWN OUR PARKS FOR TIMBER
SAID LEVIN RETURNING TO A THOUGHT THAT HAD STRUCK HIM
THERE'S A CLASS INSTINCT TOO OF WHAT ONE OUGHT AND OUGHTN'T TO DO
THERE'S THE PEASANTS TOO I WONDER AT THEM SOMETIMES ANY GOOD PEASANT TRIES TO TAKE ALL THE LAND HE CAN
WITHOUT A RETURN TOO AT A SIMPLE LOSS
I SWEAR IT ANSWERED SANCHO
I SAY SO CONTINUED DON QUIXOTE BECAUSE I HATE TAKING AWAY ANYONE'S GOOD NAME
I SAY REPLIED SANCHO THAT I SWEAR TO HOLD MY TONGUE ABOUT IT TILL THE END OF YOUR WORSHIP'S DAYS AND GOD GRANT I MAY BE ABLE TO LET IT OUT TOMORROW
THOUGH YOUR WORSHIP WAS NOT SO BADLY OFF HAVING IN YOUR ARMS THAT INCOMPARABLE BEAUTY YOU SPOKE OF BUT I WHAT DID I HAVE EXCEPT THE HEAVIEST WHACKS I THINK I HAD IN ALL MY LIFE
UNLUCKY ME AND THE MOTHER THAT BORE ME
DIDN'T I SAY SO WORSE LUCK TO MY LINE SAID SANCHO
IT CANNOT BE THE MOOR ANSWERED DON QUIXOTE FOR THOSE UNDER ENCHANTMENT DO NOT LET THEMSELVES BE SEEN BY ANYONE
IF THEY DON'T LET THEMSELVES BE SEEN THEY LET THEMSELVES BE FELT SAID SANCHO IF NOT LET MY SHOULDERS SPEAK TO THE POINT
MINE COULD SPEAK TOO SAID DON QUIXOTE BUT THAT IS NOT A SUFFICIENT REASON FOR BELIEVING THAT WHAT WE SEE IS THE ENCHANTED MOOR
THE OFFICER TURNED TO HIM AND SAID WELL HOW GOES IT GOOD MAN
SANCHO GOT UP WITH PAIN ENOUGH IN HIS BONES AND WENT AFTER THE INNKEEPER IN THE DARK AND MEETING THE OFFICER WHO WAS LOOKING TO SEE WHAT HAD BECOME OF HIS ENEMY HE SAID TO HIM SENOR WHOEVER YOU ARE DO US THE FAVOUR AND KINDNESS TO GIVE US A LITTLE ROSEMARY OIL SALT AND WINE FOR IT IS WANTED TO CURE ONE OF THE BEST KNIGHTS ERRANT ON EARTH WHO LIES ON YONDER BED WOUNDED BY THE HANDS OF THE ENCHANTED MOOR THAT IS IN THIS INN
TO BE BRIEF HE TOOK THE MATERIALS OF WHICH HE MADE A COMPOUND MIXING THEM ALL AND BOILING THEM A GOOD WHILE UNTIL IT SEEMED TO HIM THEY HAD COME TO PERFECTION
SANCHO PANZA WHO ALSO REGARDED THE AMENDMENT OF HIS MASTER AS MIRACULOUS BEGGED HIM TO GIVE HIM WHAT WAS LEFT IN THE PIGSKIN WHICH WAS NO SMALL QUANTITY
DON QUIXOTE CONSENTED AND HE TAKING IT WITH BOTH HANDS IN GOOD FAITH AND WITH A BETTER WILL GULPED DOWN AND DRAINED OFF VERY LITTLE LESS THAN HIS MASTER
IF YOUR WORSHIP KNEW THAT RETURNED SANCHO WOE BETIDE ME AND ALL MY KINDRED WHY DID YOU LET ME TASTE IT
SEARCH YOUR MEMORY AND IF YOU FIND ANYTHING OF THIS KIND YOU NEED ONLY TELL ME OF IT AND I PROMISE YOU BY THE ORDER OF KNIGHTHOOD WHICH I HAVE RECEIVED TO PROCURE YOU SATISFACTION AND REPARATION TO THE UTMOST OF YOUR DESIRE
THEN THIS IS AN INN SAID DON QUIXOTE
AND A VERY RESPECTABLE ONE SAID THE INNKEEPER
THE CRIES OF THE POOR BLANKETED WRETCH WERE SO LOUD THAT THEY REACHED THE EARS OF HIS MASTER WHO HALTING TO LISTEN ATTENTIVELY WAS PERSUADED THAT SOME NEW ADVENTURE WAS COMING UNTIL HE CLEARLY PERCEIVED THAT IT WAS HIS SQUIRE WHO UTTERED THEM
HE SAW HIM RISING AND FALLING IN THE AIR WITH SUCH GRACE AND NIMBLENESS THAT HAD HIS RAGE ALLOWED HIM IT IS MY BELIEF HE WOULD HAVE LAUGHED
SANCHO TOOK IT AND AS HE WAS RAISING IT TO HIS MOUTH HE WAS STOPPED BY THE CRIES OF HIS MASTER EXCLAIMING SANCHO MY SON DRINK NOT WATER DRINK IT NOT MY SON FOR IT WILL KILL THEE SEE HERE I HAVE THE BLESSED BALSAM AND HE HELD UP THE FLASK OF LIQUOR AND WITH DRINKING TWO DROPS OF IT THOU WILT CERTAINLY BE RESTORED
LOBSTERS AND LOBSTERS
WHEN IS A LOBSTER NOT A LOBSTER WHEN IT IS A CRAYFISH
THIS QUESTION AND ANSWER MIGHT WELL GO INTO THE PRIMER OF INFORMATION FOR THOSE WHO COME TO SAN FRANCISCO FROM THE EAST FOR WHAT IS CALLED A LOBSTER IN SAN FRANCISCO IS NOT A LOBSTER AT ALL BUT A CRAYFISH
THE PACIFIC CRAYFISH HOWEVER SERVES EVERY PURPOSE AND WHILE MANY CONTEND THAT ITS MEAT IS NOT SO DELICATE IN FLAVOR AS THAT OF ITS EASTERN COUSIN THE CALIFORNIAN WILL AS STRENUOUSLY INSIST THAT IT IS BETTER BUT OF COURSE SOMETHING MUST ALWAYS BE ALLOWED FOR THE PATRIOTISM OF THE CALIFORNIAN
A BOOK COULD BE WRITTEN ABOUT THIS RESTAURANT AND THEN ALL WOULD NOT BE TOLD FOR ALL ITS SECRETS CAN NEVER BE KNOWN
IT WAS HERE THAT MOST MAGNIFICENT DINNERS WERE ARRANGED IT WAS HERE THAT EXTRAORDINARY DISHES WERE CONCOCTED BY CHEFS OF WORLD WIDE FAME IT WAS HERE THAT LOBSTER A LA NEWBERG REACHED ITS HIGHEST PERFECTION AND THIS IS THE RECIPE THAT WAS FOLLOWED WHEN IT WAS PREPARED IN THE DELMONICO
LOBSTER A LA NEWBERG
ONE POUND OF LOBSTER MEAT ONE TEASPOONFUL OF BUTTER ONE HALF PINT OF CREAM YOLKS OF FOUR EGGS ONE WINE GLASS OF SHERRY LOBSTER FAT
PUT THIS IN A DOUBLE BOILER AND LET COOK UNTIL THICK STIRRING CONSTANTLY
SERVE IN A CHAFING DISH WITH THIN SLICES OF DRY TOAST
KING OF SHELL FISH
ONE HAS TO COME TO SAN FRANCISCO TO PARTAKE OF THE KING OF SHELL FISH THE MAMMOTH PACIFIC CRAB
I SAY COME TO SAN FRANCISCO ADVISEDLY FOR WHILE THE CRAB IS FOUND ALL ALONG THE COAST IT IS PREPARED NOWHERE SO DELICIOUSLY AS IN SAN FRANCISCO
GOBEY'S PASSED WITH THE FIRE AND THE LITTLE RESTAURANT BEARING HIS NAME AND IN CHARGE OF HIS WIDOW IN UNION SQUARE AVENUE HAS NOT ATTAINED THE FAME OF THE OLD PLACE
IT IS POSSIBLE THAT SHE KNOWS THE SECRET OF PREPARING CRAB AS IT WAS PREPARED IN THE GOBEY'S OF BEFORE THE FIRE BUT HIS PRESTIGE DID NOT DESCEND TO HER
GOBEY'S CRAB STEW
TAKE THE MEAT OF ONE LARGE CRAB SCRAPING OUT ALL OF THE FAT FROM THE SHELL
SOAK THE CRAB MEAT IN THE SHERRY TWO HOURS BEFORE COOKING
CHOP FINE THE ONION SWEET PEPPER AND TOMATO WITH THE ROSEMARY
HEAT THIS IN A STEWPAN AND WHEN SIMMERING ADD THE SHERRY AND CRAB MEAT AND LET ALL COOK TOGETHER WITH A SLOW FIRE FOR EIGHT MINUTES
SERVE IN A CHAFING DISH WITH TOASTED CRACKERS OR THIN SLICES OF TOASTED BREAD
LOBSTER IN MINIATURE
SO FAR IT HAS BEEN USED MOSTLY FOR GARNISHMENT OF OTHER DISHES AND IT IS ONLY RECENTLY THAT THE HOF BRAU HAS BEEN MAKING A SPECIALTY OF THEM
ALL OF THE BETTER CLASS RESTAURANTS HOWEVER WILL SERVE THEM IF YOU ORDER THEM
THIS IS THE RECIPE FOR EIGHT PEOPLE AND IT IS WELL WORTH TRYING IF YOU ARE GIVING A DINNER OF IMPORTANCE
BISQUE OF CRAWFISH
TAKE THIRTY CRAWFISH FROM WHICH REMOVE THE GUT CONTAINING THE GALL IN THE FOLLOWING MANNER TAKE FIRM HOLD OF THE CRAWFISH WITH THE LEFT HAND SO AS TO AVOID BEING PINCHED BY ITS CLAWS WITH THE THUMB AND FOREFINGER OF THE RIGHT HAND PINCH THE EXTREME END OF THE CENTRAL FIN OF THE TAIL AND WITH A SUDDEN JERK THE GUT WILL BE WITHDRAWN
MINCE OR CUT INTO SMALL DICE A CARROT AN ONION ONE HEAD OF CELERY AND A FEW PARSLEY ROOTS AND TO THESE ADD A BAY LEAF A SPRIG OF THYME A LITTLE MINIONETTE PEPPER AND TWO OUNCES OF BUTTER
PUT THESE INGREDIENTS INTO A STEWPAN AND FRY THEM TEN MINUTES THEN THROW IN THE CRAWFISH AND POUR ON THEM HALF A BOTTLE OF FRENCH WHITE WINE
ALLOW THIS TO BOIL AND THEN ADD A QUART OF STRONG CONSOMME AND LET ALL CONTINUE BOILING FOR HALF AN HOUR
PICK OUT THE CRAWFISH AND STRAIN THE BROTH THROUGH A NAPKIN BY PRESSURE INTO A BASIN IN ORDER TO EXTRACT ALL THE ESSENCE FROM THE VEGETABLES
PICK THE SHELLS OFF TWENTY FIVE OF THE CRAWFISH TAILS TRIM THEM NEATLY AND SET THEM ASIDE UNTIL WANTED
RESERVE SOME OF THE SPAWN ALSO HALF OF THE BODY SHELLS WITH WHICH TO MAKE THE CRAWFISH BUTTER TO FINISH THE SOUP
THIS BUTTER IS MADE AS FOLLOWS PLACE THE SHELLS ON A BAKING SHEET IN THE OVEN TO DRY LET THE SHELLS COOL AND THEN POUND THEM IN A MORTAR WITH A LITTLE LOBSTER CORAL AND FOUR OUNCES OF FRESH BUTTER THOROUGHLY BRUISING THE WHOLE TOGETHER SO AS TO MAKE A FINE PASTE
THERE WAS ONCE ON A TIME A WIDOWER WHO HAD A SON AND A DAUGHTER BY HIS FIRST WIFE
FROM THE VERY DAY THAT THE NEW WIFE CAME INTO THE HOUSE THERE WAS NO PEACE FOR THE MAN'S CHILDREN AND NOT A CORNER TO BE FOUND WHERE THEY COULD GET ANY REST SO THE BOY THOUGHT THAT THE BEST THING HE COULD DO WAS TO GO OUT INTO THE WORLD AND TRY TO EARN HIS OWN BREAD
BUT HIS SISTER WHO WAS STILL AT HOME FARED WORSE AND WORSE
KISS ME GIRL SAID THE HEAD
WHEN THE KING ENTERED AND SAW IT HE STOOD STILL AS IF HE WERE IN FETTERS AND COULD NOT STIR FROM THE SPOT FOR THE PICTURE SEEMED TO HIM SO BEAUTIFUL
THE YOUTH PROMISED TO MAKE ALL THE HASTE HE COULD AND SET FORTH FROM THE KING'S PALACE
AT LAST THEY CAME IN SIGHT OF LAND
WELL IF MY BROTHER SAYS SO I MUST DO IT SAID THE MAN'S DAUGHTER AND SHE FLUNG HER CASKET INTO THE SEA
WHAT IS MY BROTHER SAYING ASKED HIS SISTER AGAIN
ON THE FIRST THURSDAY NIGHT AFTER THIS A BEAUTIFUL MAIDEN CAME INTO THE KITCHEN OF THE PALACE AND BEGGED THE KITCHEN MAID WHO SLEPT THERE TO LEND HER A BRUSH
SHE BEGGED VERY PRETTILY AND GOT IT AND THEN SHE BRUSHED HER HAIR AND THE GOLD DROPPED FROM IT
OUT ON THEE UGLY BUSHY BRIDE SLEEPING SO SOFT BY THE YOUNG KING'S SIDE ON SAND AND STONES MY BED I MAKE AND MY BROTHER SLEEPS WITH THE COLD SNAKE UNPITIED AND UNWEPT
I SHALL COME TWICE MORE AND THEN NEVER AGAIN SAID SHE
THIS TIME ALSO AS BEFORE SHE BORROWED A BRUSH AND BRUSHED HER HAIR WITH IT AND THE GOLD DROPPED DOWN AS SHE DID IT AND AGAIN SHE SENT THE DOG OUT THREE TIMES AND WHEN DAY DAWNED SHE DEPARTED BUT AS SHE WAS GOING SHE SAID AS SHE HAD SAID BEFORE I SHALL COME ONCE MORE AND THEN NEVER AGAIN
NO ONE CAN TELL HOW DELIGHTED THE KING WAS TO GET RID OF THAT HIDEOUS BUSHY BRIDE AND GET A QUEEN WHO WAS BRIGHT AND BEAUTIFUL AS DAY ITSELF
WILT THOU SERVE ME AND WATCH MY SEVEN FOALS ASKED THE KING
THE YOUTH THOUGHT THAT IT WAS VERY EASY WORK TO WATCH THE FOALS AND THAT HE COULD DO IT WELL ENOUGH
HAST THOU WATCHED FAITHFULLY AND WELL THE WHOLE DAY LONG SAID THE KING WHEN THE LAD CAME INTO HIS PRESENCE IN THE EVENING
YES THAT I HAVE SAID THE YOUTH
HE HAD GONE OUT ONCE TO SEEK A PLACE HE SAID BUT NEVER WOULD HE DO SUCH A THING AGAIN
THEN THE KING PROMISED HIM THE SAME PUNISHMENT AND THE SAME REWARD THAT HE HAD PROMISED HIS BROTHER
WHEN HE HAD RUN AFTER THE FOALS FOR A LONG LONG TIME AND WAS HOT AND TIRED HE PASSED BY A CLEFT IN THE ROCK WHERE AN OLD WOMAN WAS SITTING SPINNING WITH A DISTAFF AND SHE CALLED TO HIM
COME HITHER COME HITHER MY HANDSOME SON AND LET ME COMB YOUR HAIR
THE YOUTH LIKED THE THOUGHT OF THIS LET THE FOALS RUN WHERE THEY CHOSE AND SEATED HIMSELF IN THE CLEFT OF THE ROCK BY THE SIDE OF THE OLD HAG
SO THERE HE SAT WITH HIS HEAD ON HER LAP TAKING HIS EASE THE LIVELONG DAY
ON THE THIRD DAY CINDERLAD WANTED TO SET OUT
THE TWO BROTHERS LAUGHED AT HIM AND HIS FATHER AND MOTHER BEGGED HIM NOT TO GO BUT ALL TO NO PURPOSE AND CINDERLAD SET OUT ON HIS WAY
I AM WALKING ABOUT IN SEARCH OF A PLACE SAID CINDERLAD
I WOULD MUCH RATHER HAVE THE PRINCESS SAID CINDERLAD
AND THUS THEY JOURNEYED ONWARDS A LONG LONG WAY
WHEN THEY HAD GONE THUS FOR A LONG LONG WAY THE FOAL AGAIN ASKED DOST THOU SEE ANYTHING NOW
YES NOW I SEE SOMETHING THAT IS WHITE SAID CINDERLAD
IT LOOKS LIKE THE TRUNK OF A GREAT THICK BIRCH TREE
CINDERLAD TRIED BUT COULD NOT DO IT SO HE HAD TO TAKE A DRAUGHT FROM THE PITCHER AND THEN ONE MORE AND AFTER THAT STILL ANOTHER AND THEN HE WAS ABLE TO WIELD THE SWORD WITH PERFECT EASE
FOR WE ARE BROTHERS OF THE PRINCESS WHOM THOU ART TO HAVE WHEN THOU CANST TELL THE KING WHAT WE EAT AND DRINK BUT THERE IS A MIGHTY TROLL WHO HAS CAST A SPELL OVER US
WHEN THEY HAD TRAVELLED A LONG LONG WAY THE FOAL SAID DOST THOU SEE ANYTHING
AND NOW INQUIRED THE FOAL SEEST THOU NOTHING NOW
NOW THEN SAID THE FOAL DOST THOU NOT SEE ANYTHING NOW
THAT IS A RIVER SAID THE FOAL AND WE HAVE TO CROSS IT
I HAVE DONE MY BEST REPLIED CINDERLAD
ONCE UPON A TIME THERE WAS A KING IN THE NORTH WHO HAD WON MANY WARS BUT NOW HE WAS OLD
THE OLD KING WENT OUT AND FOUGHT BRAVELY BUT AT LAST HIS SWORD BROKE AND HE WAS WOUNDED AND HIS MEN FLED
BUT IN THE NIGHT WHEN THE BATTLE WAS OVER HIS YOUNG WIFE CAME OUT AND SEARCHED FOR HIM AMONG THE SLAIN AND AT LAST SHE FOUND HIM AND ASKED WHETHER HE MIGHT BE HEALED
SO HE ASKED THE QUEEN HOW DO YOU KNOW IN THE DARK OF NIGHT WHETHER THE HOURS ARE WEARING TO THE MORNING AND SHE SAID
THEN THE OLD MAN SAID DRIVE ALL THE HORSES INTO THE RIVER AND CHOOSE THE ONE THAT SWIMS ACROSS
HE IS NO BIGGER THAN OTHER DRAGONS SAID THE TUTOR AND IF YOU WERE AS BRAVE AS YOUR FATHER YOU WOULD NOT FEAR HIM
THEN THE PERSON WHO HAD KILLED OTTER WENT DOWN AND CAUGHT THE DWARF WHO OWNED ALL THE TREASURE AND TOOK IT FROM HIM
ONLY ONE RING WAS LEFT WHICH THE DWARF WORE AND EVEN THAT WAS TAKEN FROM HIM
SO REGIN MADE A SWORD AND SIGURD TRIED IT WITH A BLOW ON A LUMP OF IRON AND THE SWORD BROKE
THEN SIGURD WENT TO HIS MOTHER AND ASKED FOR THE BROKEN PIECES OF HIS FATHER'S BLADE AND GAVE THEM TO REGIN
SO SIGURD SAID THAT SWORD WOULD DO
THEN HE SAW THE TRACK WHICH THE DRAGON MADE WHEN HE WENT TO A CLIFF TO DRINK AND THE TRACK WAS AS IF A GREAT RIVER HAD ROLLED ALONG AND LEFT A DEEP VALLEY
BUT SIGURD WAITED TILL HALF OF HIM HAD CRAWLED OVER THE PIT AND THEN HE THRUST THE SWORD GRAM RIGHT INTO HIS VERY HEART
SIGURD SAID I WOULD TOUCH NONE OF IT IF BY LOSING IT I SHOULD NEVER DIE
BUT ALL MEN DIE AND NO BRAVE MAN LETS DEATH FRIGHTEN HIM FROM HIS DESIRE
DIE THOU FAFNIR AND THEN FAFNIR DIED
THEN SIGURD RODE BACK AND MET REGIN AND REGIN ASKED HIM TO ROAST FAFNIR'S HEART AND LET HIM TASTE OF IT
SO SIGURD PUT THE HEART OF FAFNIR ON A STAKE AND ROASTED IT
THERE IS SIGURD ROASTING FAFNIR'S HEART FOR ANOTHER WHEN HE SHOULD TASTE OF IT HIMSELF AND LEARN ALL WISDOM
THAT LET HIM DO AND THEN RIDE OVER HINDFELL TO THE PLACE WHERE BRYNHILD SLEEPS
THERE MUST SHE SLEEP TILL THOU COMEST FOR HER WAKING RISE UP AND RIDE FOR NOW SURE SHE WILL SWEAR THE VOW FEARLESS OF BREAKING
THEN HE TOOK THE HELMET OFF THE HEAD OF THE SLEEPER AND BEHOLD SHE WAS A MOST BEAUTIFUL LADY
THEN SIGURD RODE AWAY AND HE CAME TO THE HOUSE OF A KING WHO HAD A FAIR DAUGHTER
THEN BRYNHILD'S FATHER TOLD GUNNAR THAT SHE WOULD MARRY NONE BUT HIM WHO COULD RIDE THE FLAME IN FRONT OF HER ENCHANTED TOWER AND THITHER THEY RODE AND GUNNAR SET HIS HORSE AT THE FLAME BUT HE WOULD NOT FACE IT
FOR ONE DAY WHEN BRYNHILD AND GUDRUN WERE BATHING BRYNHILD WADED FARTHEST OUT INTO THE RIVER AND SAID SHE DID THAT TO SHOW SHE WAS GUIRUN'S SUPERIOR
FOR HER HUSBAND SHE SAID HAD RIDDEN THROUGH THE FLAME WHEN NO OTHER MAN DARED FACE IT
NOT LONG TO WAIT HE SAID TILL THE BITTER SWORD STANDS FAST IN MY HEART AND THOU WILL NOT LIVE LONG WHEN I AM DEAD
GENERAL OBSERVATIONS ON PRESERVES CONFECTIONARY ICES AND DESSERT DISHES
THE EXPENSE OF PRESERVING THEM WITH SUGAR IS A SERIOUS OBJECTION FOR EXCEPT THE SUGAR IS USED IN CONSIDERABLE QUANTITIES THE SUCCESS IS VERY UNCERTAIN
FRUIT GATHERED IN WET OR FOGGY WEATHER WILL SOON BE MILDEWED AND BE OF NO SERVICE FOR PRESERVES
BUT TO DISTINGUISH THESE PROPERLY REQUIRES VERY GREAT ATTENTION AND CONSIDERABLE EXPERIENCE
IF YOU DIP THE FINGER INTO THE SYRUP AND APPLY IT TO THE THUMB THE TENACITY OF THE SYRUP WILL ON SEPARATING THE FINGER AND THUMB AFFORD A THREAD WHICH SHORTLY BREAKS THIS IS THE LITTLE THREAD
LET IT BOIL UP AGAIN THEN TAKE IT OFF AND REMOVE CAREFULLY THE SCUM THAT HAS RISEN
IT IS CONSIDERED TO BE SUFFICIENTLY BOILED WHEN SOME TAKEN UP IN A SPOON POURS OUT LIKE OIL
BEFORE SUGAR WAS IN USE HONEY WAS EMPLOYED TO PRESERVE MANY VEGETABLE PRODUCTIONS THOUGH THIS SUBSTANCE HAS NOW GIVEN WAY TO THE JUICE OF THE SUGAR CANE
FOURTEEN NINETY NINE
BOIL THEM UP THREE DAYS SUCCESSIVELY SKIMMING EACH TIME AND THEY WILL THEN BE FINISHED AND IN A STATE FIT TO BE PUT INTO POTS FOR USE
THE REASON WHY THE FRUIT IS EMPTIED OUT OF THE PRESERVING PAN INTO AN EARTHEN PAN IS THAT THE ACID OF THE FRUIT ACTS UPON THE COPPER OF WHICH THE PRESERVING PANS ARE USUALLY MADE
FROM THIS EXAMPLE THE PROCESS OF PRESERVING FRUITS BY SYRUP WILL BE EASILY COMPREHENDED
THEY SHOULD BE DRIED IN THE STOVE OR OVEN ON A SIEVE AND TURNED EVERY SIX OR EIGHT HOURS FRESH POWDERED SUGAR BEING SIFTED OVER THEM EVERY TIME THEY ARE TURNED
IN THIS WAY IT IS ALSO THAT ORANGE AND LEMON CHIPS ARE PRESERVED
MARMALADES JAMS AND FRUIT PASTES ARE OF THE SAME NATURE AND ARE NOW IN VERY GENERAL REQUEST
MARMALADES AND JAMS DIFFER LITTLE FROM EACH OTHER THEY ARE PRESERVES OF A HALF LIQUID CONSISTENCY MADE BY BOILING THE PULP OF FRUITS AND SOMETIMES PART OF THE RINDS WITH SUGAR
THAT THEY MAY KEEP IT IS NECESSARY NOT TO BE SPARING OF SUGAR FIFTEEN O THREE
IN ALL THE OPERATIONS FOR PRESERVE MAKING WHEN THE PRESERVING PAN IS USED IT SHOULD NOT BE PLACED ON THE FIRE BUT ON A TRIVET UNLESS THE JAM IS MADE ON A HOT PLATE WHEN THIS IS NOT NECESSARY
CONFECTIONARY FIFTEEN O EIGHT
IN SPEAKING OF CONFECTIONARY IT SHOULD BE REMARKED THAT ALL THE VARIOUS PREPARATIONS ABOVE NAMED COME STRICTLY SPEAKING UNDER THAT HEAD FOR THE VARIOUS FRUITS FLOWERS HERBS ROOTS AND JUICES WHICH WHEN BOILED WITH SUGAR WERE FORMERLY EMPLOYED IN PHARMACY AS WELL AS FOR SWEETMEATS WERE CALLED CONFECTIONS FROM THE LATIN WORD CONFICERE TO MAKE UP BUT THE TERM CONFECTIONARY EMBRACES A VERY LARGE CLASS INDEED OF SWEET FOOD MANY KINDS OF WHICH SHOULD NOT BE ATTEMPTED IN THE ORDINARY CUISINE
THE THOUSAND AND ONE ORNAMENTAL DISHES THAT ADORN THE TABLES OF THE WEALTHY SHOULD BE PURCHASED FROM THE CONFECTIONER THEY CANNOT PROFITABLY BE MADE AT HOME
HOWEVER AS LATE AS THE REIGNS OF OUR TWO LAST GEORGES FABULOUS SUMS WERE OFTEN EXPENDED UPON FANCIFUL DESSERTS
THE SHAPE OF THE DISHES VARIES AT DIFFERENT PERIODS THE PREVAILING FASHION AT PRESENT BEING OVAL AND CIRCULAR DISHES ON STEMS
ICES
AT DESSERTS OR AT SOME EVENING PARTIES ICES ARE SCARCELY TO BE DISPENSED WITH
THE SPADDLE IS GENERALLY MADE OF COPPER KEPT BRIGHT AND CLEAN
THEY SHOULD BE TAKEN IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE REPAST OR SOME HOURS AFTER BECAUSE THE TAKING THESE SUBSTANCES DURING THE PROCESS OF DIGESTION IS APT TO PROVOKE INDISPOSITION
HIS FOLLOWERS RUSHED FORWARD TO WHERE HE LAY AND THEIR UNITED FORCE COMPELLING THE BLACK KNIGHT TO PAUSE THEY DRAGGED THEIR WOUNDED LEADER WITHIN THE WALLS
IT WAS ON THEIR JOURNEY TO THAT TOWN THAT THEY WERE OVERTAKEN ON THE ROAD BY CEDRIC AND HIS PARTY IN WHOSE COMPANY THEY WERE AFTERWARDS CARRIED CAPTIVE TO THE CASTLE OF TORQUILSTONE
AS HE LAY UPON HIS BED RACKED WITH PAIN AND MENTAL AGONY AND FILLED WITH THE FEAR OF RAPIDLY APPROACHING DEATH HE HEARD A VOICE ADDRESS HIM
WHAT ART THOU HE EXCLAIMED IN TERROR
LEAVE ME AND SEEK THE SAXON WITCH ULRICA WHO WAS MY TEMPTRESS LET HER AS WELL AS I TASTE THE TORTURES WHICH ANTICIPATE HELL
EXCLAIMED THE NORMAN HO
REMEMBEREST THOU THE MAGAZINE OF FUEL THAT IS STORED BENEATH THESE APARTMENTS WOMAN
THEY ARE FAST RISING AT LEAST SAID ULRICA AND A SIGNAL SHALL SOON WAVE TO WARN THE BESIEGERS TO PRESS HARD UPON THOSE WHO WOULD EXTINGUISH THEM
MEANWHILE THE BLACK KNIGHT HAD LED HIS FORCES AGAIN TO THE ATTACK AND SO VIGOROUS WAS THEIR ASSAULT THAT BEFORE LONG THE GATE OF THE CASTLE ALONE SEPARATED THEM FROM THOSE WITHIN
THE DEFENDERS FINDING THE CASTLE TO BE ON FIRE NOW DETERMINED TO SELL THEIR LIVES AS DEARLY AS THEY COULD AND HEADED BY DE BRACY THEY THREW OPEN THE GATE AND WERE AT ONCE INVOLVED IN A TERRIFIC CONFLICT WITH THOSE OUTSIDE
THE BLACK KNIGHT WITH PORTENTOUS STRENGTH FORCED HIS WAY INWARD IN DESPITE OF DE BRACY AND HIS FOLLOWERS
TWO OF THE FOREMOST INSTANTLY FELL AND THE REST GAVE WAY NOTWITHSTANDING ALL THEIR LEADERS EFFORTS TO STOP THEM
THE BLACK KNIGHT WAS SOON ENGAGED IN DESPERATE COMBAT WITH THE NORMAN CHIEF AND THE VAULTED ROOF OF THE HALL RUNG WITH THEIR FURIOUS BLOWS
AT LENGTH DE BRACY FELL
TELL ME THY NAME OR WORK THY PLEASURE ON ME
YET FIRST LET ME SAY SAID DE BRACY WHAT IT IMPORTS THEE TO KNOW
EXCLAIMED THE BLACK KNIGHT PRISONER AND PERISH
THE LIFE OF EVERY MAN IN THE CASTLE SHALL ANSWER IT IF A HAIR OF HIS HEAD BE SINGED SHOW ME HIS CHAMBER
RAISING THE WOUNDED MAN WITH EASE THE BLACK KNIGHT RUSHED WITH HIM TO THE POSTERN GATE AND HAVING THERE DELIVERED HIS BURDEN TO THE CARE OF TWO YEOMEN HE AGAIN ENTERED THE CASTLE TO ASSIST IN THE RESCUE OF THE OTHER PRISONERS
BUT IN OTHER PARTS THE BESIEGERS PURSUED THE DEFENDERS OF THE CASTLE FROM CHAMBER TO CHAMBER AND SATIATED IN THEIR BLOOD THE VENGEANCE WHICH HAD LONG ANIMATED THEM AGAINST THE SOLDIERS OF THE TYRANT FRONT DE BOEUF
AS THE FIRE COMMENCED TO SPREAD RAPIDLY THROUGH ALL PARTS OF THE CASTLE ULRICA APPEARED ON ONE OF THE TURRETS
BEFORE LONG THE TOWERING FLAMES HAD SURMOUNTED EVERY OBSTRUCTION AND ROSE TO THE EVENING SKIES ONE HUGE AND BURNING BEACON SEEN FAR AND WIDE THROUGH THE ADJACENT COUNTRY TOWER AFTER TOWER CRASHED DOWN WITH BLAZING ROOF AND RAFTER
AT LENGTH WITH A TERRIFIC CRASH THE WHOLE TURRET GAVE WAY AND SHE PERISHED IN THE FLAMES WHICH HAD CONSUMED HER TYRANT
WHEN THE OUTLAWS HAD DIVIDED THE SPOILS WHICH THEY HAD TAKEN FROM THE CASTLE OF TORQUILSTONE CEDRIC PREPARED TO TAKE HIS DEPARTURE
HE LEFT THE GALLANT BAND OF FORESTERS SORROWING DEEPLY FOR HIS LOST FRIEND THE LORD OF CONINGSBURGH AND HE AND HIS FOLLOWERS HAD SCARCE DEPARTED WHEN A PROCESSION MOVED SLOWLY FROM UNDER THE GREENWOOD BRANCHES IN THE DIRECTION WHICH HE HAD TAKEN IN THE CENTRE OF WHICH WAS THE CAR IN WHICH THE BODY OF ATHELSTANE WAS LAID
DE BRACY BOWED LOW AND IN SILENCE THREW HIMSELF UPON A HORSE AND GALLOPED OFF THROUGH THE WOOD
HERE IS A BUGLE WHICH AN ENGLISH YEOMAN HAS ONCE WORN I PRAY YOU TO KEEP IT AS A MEMORIAL OF YOUR GALLANT BEARING
SO SAYING HE MOUNTED HIS STRONG WAR HORSE AND RODE OFF THROUGH THE FOREST
DURING ALL THIS TIME ISAAC OF YORK SAT MOURNFULLY APART GRIEVING FOR THE LOSS OF HIS DEARLY LOVED DAUGHTER REBECCA
AND WITH THIS EPISTLE THE UNHAPPY OLD MAN SET OUT TO PROCURE HIS DAUGHTER'S LIBERATION
THE TEMPLAR IS FLED SAID DE BRACY IN ANSWER TO THE PRINCE'S EAGER QUESTIONS FRONT DE BOEUF YOU WILL NEVER SEE MORE AND HE ADDED IN A LOW AND EMPHATIC TONE RICHARD IS IN ENGLAND I HAVE SEEN HIM AND SPOKEN WITH HIM
HE APPEALED TO DE BRACY TO ASSIST HIM IN THIS PROJECT AND BECAME AT ONCE DEEPLY SUSPICIOUS OF THE KNIGHT'S LOYALTY TOWARDS HIM WHEN HE DECLINED TO LIFT HAND AGAINST THE MAN WHO HAD SPARED HIS OWN LIFE
BEFORE REACHING HIS DESTINATION HE WAS TOLD THAT LUCAS DE BEAUMANOIR THE GRAND MASTER OF THE ORDER OF THE TEMPLARS WAS THEN ON VISIT TO THE PRECEPTORY
HE HAD NOT UNTIL THEN BEEN INFORMED OF THE PRESENCE OF THE JEWISH MAIDEN IN THE ABODE OF THE TEMPLARS AND GREAT WAS HIS FURY AND INDIGNATION ON LEARNING THAT SHE WAS AMONGST THEM
POOR ISAAC WAS HURRIED OFF ACCORDINGLY AND EXPELLED FROM THE PRECEPTORY ALL HIS ENTREATIES AND EVEN HIS OFFERS UNHEARD AND DISREGARDED
THE ASSURANCE THAT SHE POSSESSED SOME FRIEND IN THIS AWFUL ASSEMBLY GAVE HER COURAGE TO LOOK AROUND AND TO MARK INTO WHOSE PRESENCE SHE HAD BEEN CONDUCTED
SHE GAZED ACCORDINGLY UPON A SCENE WHICH MIGHT WELL HAVE STRUCK TERROR INTO A BOLDER HEART THAN HERS
AT HIS FEET WAS PLACED A TABLE OCCUPIED BY TWO SCRIBES WHOSE DUTY IT WAS TO RECORD THE PROCEEDINGS OF THE DAY
THE PRECEPTORS OF WHOM THERE WERE FOUR PRESENT OCCUPIED SEATS BEHIND THEIR SUPERIORS AND BEHIND THEM STOOD THE ESQUIRES OF THE ORDER ROBED IN WHITE
AND LAURA HAD HER OWN PET PLANS
SHE MEANT TO BE SCRUPULOUSLY CONSCIENTIOUS IN THE ADMINISTRATION OF HER TALENTS AND SOMETIMES AT CHURCH ON A SUNDAY WHEN THE SERMON WAS PARTICULARLY AWAKENING SHE MENTALLY DEBATED THE SERIOUS QUESTION AS TO WHETHER NEW BONNETS AND A PAIR OF JOUVIN'S GLOVES DAILY WERE NOT SINFUL BUT I THINK SHE DECIDED THAT THE NEW BONNETS AND GLOVES WERE ON THE WHOLE A PARDONABLE WEAKNESS AS BEING GOOD FOR TRADE
ONE MORNING LAURA TOLD HER HUSBAND WITH A GAY LAUGH THAT SHE WAS GOING TO VICTIMIZE HIM BUT HE WAS TO PROMISE TO BE PATIENT AND BEAR WITH HER FOR ONCE IN A WAY
I WANT TO SEE ALL THE PICTURES THE MODERN PICTURES ESPECIALLY
I REMEMBER ALL THE RUBENSES AT THE LOUVRE FOR I SAW THEM THREE YEARS AGO WHEN I WAS STAYING IN PARIS WITH GRANDPAPA
SHE RETURNED IN A LITTLE MORE THAN TEN MINUTES IN THE FRESHEST TOILETTE ALL PALE SHIMMERING BLUE LIKE THE SPRING SKY WITH PEARL GREY GLOVES AND BOOTS AND PARASOL AND A BONNET THAT SEEMED MADE OF AZURE BUTTERFLIES
IT WAS DRAWING TOWARDS THE CLOSE OF THIS DELIGHTFUL HONEYMOON TOUR AND IT WAS A BRIGHT SUNSHINY MORNING EARLY IN FEBRUARY BUT FEBRUARY IN PARIS IS SOMETIMES BETTER THAN APRIL IN LONDON
BUT SHE FIXED UPON A PICTURE WHICH SHE SAID SHE PREFERRED TO ANYTHING SHE HAD SEEN IN THE GALLERY
PHILIP JOCELYN WAS EXAMINING SOME PICTURES ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ROOM WHEN HIS WIFE MADE THIS DISCOVERY
HOW I WISH YOU COULD GET ME A COPY OF THAT PICTURE PHILIP LAURA SAID ENTREATINGLY
I SHOULD SO LIKE ONE TO HANG IN MY MORNING ROOM AT JOCELYN'S ROCK
SHE TURNED TO THE FRENCH ARTIST PRESENTLY AND ASKED HIM WHERE THE ELDER MISTER KERSTALL LIVED AND IF THERE WAS ANY POSSIBILITY OF SEEING HIM
THEY HAVE SAID THAT HE IS EVEN A LITTLE IMBECILE THAT HE DOES NOT REMEMBER HIMSELF OF THE MOST COMMON EVENTS OF HIS LIFE
BUT THERE ARE SOME OTHERS WHO SAY THAT HIS MEMORY HAS NOT ALTOGETHER FAILED AND THAT HE IS STILL ENOUGH HARSHLY CRITICAL TOWARDS THE WORKS OF OTHERS
I DON'T THINK YOU WILL HAVE ANY DIFFICULTY IN FINDING THE HOUSE
YOU WILL BE DOING ME SUCH A FAVOUR PHILIP IF YOU'LL SAY YES
WHEN IT WAS THE SEVEN HUNDRED AND EIGHTEENTH NIGHT
BUT HE ANSWERED NEEDS MUST I HAVE ZAYNAB ALSO NOW SUDDENLY THERE CAME A RAP AT THE DOOR AND THE MAID SAID WHO IS AT THE DOOR
THE KNOCKER REPLIED KAMAR DAUGHTER OF AZARIAH THE JEW SAY ME IS ALI OF CAIRO WITH YOU
REPLIED THE BROKER'S DAUGHTER O THOU DAUGHTER OF A DOG
AND HAVING THUS ISLAMISED SHE ASKED HIM DO MEN IN THE FAITH OF AL ISLAM GIVE MARRIAGE PORTIONS TO WOMEN OR DO WOMEN DOWER MEN
AND SHE THREW DOWN THE JEW'S HEAD BEFORE HIM
NOW THE CAUSE OF HER SLAYING HER SIRE WAS AS FOLLOWS
THEN HE SET OUT REJOICING TO RETURN TO THE BARRACK OF THE FORTY
SO HE ATE AND FELL DOWN SENSELESS FOR THE SWEETMEATS WERE DRUGGED WITH BHANG WHEREUPON THE KAZI BUNDLED HIM INTO THE SACK AND MADE OFF WITH HIM CHARGER AND CHEST AND ALL TO THE BARRACK OF THE FORTY
PRESENTLY HASAN SHUMAN CAME OUT OF A CLOSET AND SAID TO HIM HAST THOU GOTTEN THE GEAR O ALI
SO HE TOLD HIM WHAT HAD BEFALLEN HIM AND ADDED IF I KNOW WHITHER THE RASCAL IS GONE AND WHERE TO FIND THE KNAVE I WOULD PAY HIM OUT
KNOWEST THOU WHITHER HE WENT
ANSWERED HASAN I KNOW WHERE HE IS AND OPENING THE DOOR OF THE CLOSET SHOWED HIM THE SWEETMEAT SELLER WITHIN DRUGGED AND SENSELESS
SO I WENT ROUND ABOUT THE HIGHWAYS OF THE CITY TILL I MET A SWEETMEAT SELLER AND BUYING HIS CLOTHES AND STOCK IN TRADE AND GEAR FOR TEN DINARS DID WHAT WAS DONE
QUOTH AL RASHID WHOSE HEAD IS THIS
SO ALI RELATED TO HIM ALL THAT HAD PASSED FROM FIRST TO LAST AND THE CALIPH SAID I HAD NOT THOUGHT THOU WOULDST KILL HIM FOR THAT HE WAS A SORCERER
HE REPLIED I HAVE FORTY LADS BUT THEY ARE IN CAIRO
THE STRIDES OF A LAME MAN ARE LIKE THE OGLING GLANCES OF A ONE EYED MAN THEY DO NOT REACH THEIR GOAL VERY PROMPTLY
COSETTE HAD WAKED UP
JEAN VALJEAN HAD PLACED HER NEAR THE FIRE
YOU WILL WAIT FOR ME AT A LADY'S HOUSE I SHALL COME TO FETCH YOU
EVERYTHING IS ARRANGED AND NOTHING IS SAID FAUCHELEVENT
I HAVE PERMISSION TO BRING YOU IN BUT BEFORE BRINGING YOU IN YOU MUST BE GOT OUT
THAT'S WHERE THE DIFFICULTY LIES
IT IS EASY ENOUGH WITH THE CHILD YOU WILL CARRY HER OUT
AND SHE WILL HOLD HER TONGUE I ANSWER FOR THAT
FAUCHELEVENT GRUMBLED MORE TO HIMSELF THAN TO JEAN VALJEAN
YOU UNDERSTAND FATHER MADELEINE THE GOVERNMENT WILL NOTICE IT
JEAN VALJEAN STARED HIM STRAIGHT IN THE EYE AND THOUGHT THAT HE WAS RAVING
FAUCHELEVENT WENT ON
IT IS TO MORROW THAT I AM TO BRING YOU IN THE PRIORESS EXPECTS YOU
THEN HE EXPLAINED TO JEAN VALJEAN THAT THIS WAS HIS RECOMPENSE FOR A SERVICE WHICH HE FAUCHELEVENT WAS TO RENDER TO THE COMMUNITY
THAT THE NUN WHO HAD DIED THAT MORNING HAD REQUESTED TO BE BURIED IN THE COFFIN WHICH HAD SERVED HER FOR A BED AND INTERRED IN THE VAULT UNDER THE ALTAR OF THE CHAPEL
THAT THE PRIORESS AND THE VOCAL MOTHERS INTENDED TO FULFIL THE WISH OF THE DECEASED
THAT HE FAUCHELEVENT WAS TO NAIL UP THE COFFIN IN THE CELL RAISE THE STONE IN THE CHAPEL AND LOWER THE CORPSE INTO THE VAULT
AND THEN THAT THERE WAS ANOTHER THE EMPTY COFFIN
WHAT IS THAT EMPTY COFFIN
ASKED JEAN VALJEAN FAUCHELEVENT REPLIED
WHAT COFFIN WHAT ADMINISTRATION
FAUCHELEVENT WHO WAS SEATED SPRANG UP AS THOUGH A BOMB HAD BURST UNDER HIS CHAIR YOU
YOU KNOW FAUCHELEVENT WHAT YOU HAVE SAID MOTHER CRUCIFIXION IS DEAD
AND I ADD AND FATHER MADELEINE IS BURIED AH
YOU ARE NOT LIKE OTHER MEN FATHER MADELEINE
THIS OFFERS THE MEANS BUT GIVE ME SOME INFORMATION IN THE FIRST PLACE
HOW LONG IS THE COFFIN SIX FEET
IT IS A CHAMBER ON THE GROUND FLOOR WHICH HAS A GRATED WINDOW OPENING ON THE GARDEN WHICH IS CLOSED ON THE OUTSIDE BY A SHUTTER AND TWO DOORS ONE LEADS INTO THE CONVENT THE OTHER INTO THE CHURCH WHAT CHURCH
THE CHURCH IN THE STREET THE CHURCH WHICH ANY ONE CAN ENTER
HAVE YOU THE KEYS TO THOSE TWO DOORS
NO I HAVE THE KEY TO THE DOOR WHICH COMMUNICATES WITH THE CONVENT THE PORTER HAS THE KEY TO THE DOOR WHICH COMMUNICATES WITH THE CHURCH
ONLY TO ALLOW THE UNDERTAKER'S MEN TO ENTER WHEN THEY COME TO GET THE COFFIN
WHO NAILS UP THE COFFIN I DO
WHO SPREADS THE PALL OVER IT
NOT ANOTHER MAN EXCEPT THE POLICE DOCTOR CAN ENTER THE DEAD ROOM THAT IS EVEN WRITTEN ON THE WALL
COULD YOU HIDE ME IN THAT ROOM TO NIGHT WHEN EVERY ONE IS ASLEEP
ABOUT THREE O'CLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON
I SHALL BE HUNGRY I WILL BRING YOU SOMETHING
YOU CAN COME AND NAIL ME UP IN THE COFFIN AT TWO O'CLOCK
FAUCHELEVENT RECOILED AND CRACKED HIS FINGER JOINTS BUT THAT IS IMPOSSIBLE
BAH IMPOSSIBLE TO TAKE A HAMMER AND DRIVE SOME NAILS IN A PLANK
JEAN VALJEAN HAD BEEN IN WORSE STRAITS THAN THIS
ANY MAN WHO HAS BEEN A PRISONER UNDERSTANDS HOW TO CONTRACT HIMSELF TO FIT THE DIAMETER OF THE ESCAPE
WHAT DOES NOT A MAN UNDERGO FOR THE SAKE OF A CURE
TO HAVE HIMSELF NAILED UP IN A CASE AND CARRIED OFF LIKE A BALE OF GOODS TO LIVE FOR A LONG TIME IN A BOX TO FIND AIR WHERE THERE IS NONE TO ECONOMIZE HIS BREATH FOR HOURS TO KNOW HOW TO STIFLE WITHOUT DYING THIS WAS ONE OF JEAN VALJEAN'S GLOOMY TALENTS
YOU SURELY MUST HAVE A GIMLET YOU WILL MAKE A FEW HOLES HERE AND THERE AROUND MY MOUTH AND YOU WILL NAIL THE TOP PLANK ON LOOSELY GOOD AND WHAT IF YOU SHOULD HAPPEN TO COUGH OR TO SNEEZE
A MAN WHO IS MAKING HIS ESCAPE DOES NOT COUGH OR SNEEZE
WHO IS THERE WHO HAS NOT SAID TO A CAT DO COME IN
THE OVER PRUDENT CATS AS THEY ARE AND BECAUSE THEY ARE CATS SOMETIMES INCUR MORE DANGER THAN THE AUDACIOUS
BUT JEAN VALJEAN'S COOLNESS PREVAILED OVER HIM IN SPITE OF HIMSELF HE GRUMBLED
IF YOU ARE SURE OF COMING OUT OF THE COFFIN ALL RIGHT I AM SURE OF GETTING YOU OUT OF THE GRAVE
AN OLD FELLOW OF THE OLD SCHOOL THE GRAVE DIGGER PUTS THE CORPSES IN THE GRAVE AND I PUT THE GRAVE DIGGER IN MY POCKET
I SHALL FOLLOW THAT IS MY BUSINESS
THE HEARSE HALTS THE UNDERTAKER'S MEN KNOT A ROPE AROUND YOUR COFFIN AND LOWER YOU DOWN
THE PRIEST SAYS THE PRAYERS MAKES THE SIGN OF THE CROSS SPRINKLES THE HOLY WATER AND TAKES HIS DEPARTURE
ONE OF TWO THINGS WILL HAPPEN HE WILL EITHER BE SOBER OR HE WILL NOT BE SOBER
THAT IS SETTLED FATHER FAUCHELEVENT ALL WILL GO WELL
ON THE FOLLOWING DAY AS THE SUN WAS DECLINING THE VERY RARE PASSERS BY ON THE BOULEVARD DU MAINE PULLED OFF THEIR HATS TO AN OLD FASHIONED HEARSE ORNAMENTED WITH SKULLS CROSS BONES AND TEARS
THIS HEARSE CONTAINED A COFFIN COVERED WITH A WHITE CLOTH OVER WHICH SPREAD A LARGE BLACK CROSS LIKE A HUGE CORPSE WITH DROOPING ARMS
A MOURNING COACH IN WHICH COULD BE SEEN A PRIEST IN HIS SURPLICE AND A CHOIR BOY IN HIS RED CAP FOLLOWED
BEHIND IT CAME AN OLD MAN IN THE GARMENTS OF A LABORER WHO LIMPED ALONG
THE GRAVE DIGGERS BEING THUS BOUND TO SERVICE IN THE EVENING IN SUMMER AND AT NIGHT IN WINTER IN THIS CEMETERY THEY WERE SUBJECTED TO A SPECIAL DISCIPLINE
THESE GATES THEREFORE SWUNG INEXORABLY ON THEIR HINGES AT THE INSTANT WHEN THE SUN DISAPPEARED BEHIND THE DOME OF THE INVALIDES
DAMPNESS WAS INVADING IT THE FLOWERS WERE DESERTING IT
THE BOURGEOIS DID NOT CARE MUCH ABOUT BEING BURIED IN THE VAUGIRARD IT HINTED AT POVERTY PERE LACHAISE IF YOU PLEASE
TO BE BURIED IN PERE LACHAISE IS EQUIVALENT TO HAVING FURNITURE OF MAHOGANY IT IS RECOGNIZED AS ELEGANT
THE INTERMENT OF MOTHER CRUCIFIXION IN THE VAULT UNDER THE ALTAR THE EXIT OF COSETTE THE INTRODUCTION OF JEAN VALJEAN TO THE DEAD ROOM ALL HAD BEEN EXECUTED WITHOUT DIFFICULTY AND THERE HAD BEEN NO HITCH LET US REMARK IN PASSING THAT THE BURIAL OF MOTHER CRUCIFIXION UNDER THE ALTAR OF THE CONVENT IS A PERFECTLY VENIAL OFFENCE IN OUR SIGHT
IT IS ONE OF THE FAULTS WHICH RESEMBLE A DUTY
THE NUNS HAD COMMITTED IT NOT ONLY WITHOUT DIFFICULTY BUT EVEN WITH THE APPLAUSE OF THEIR OWN CONSCIENCES
IN THE CLOISTER WHAT IS CALLED THE GOVERNMENT IS ONLY AN INTERMEDDLING WITH AUTHORITY AN INTERFERENCE WHICH IS ALWAYS QUESTIONABLE
MAKE AS MANY LAWS AS YOU PLEASE MEN BUT KEEP THEM FOR YOURSELVES
A PRINCE IS NOTHING IN THE PRESENCE OF A PRINCIPLE
FAUCHELEVENT LIMPED ALONG BEHIND THE HEARSE IN A VERY CONTENTED FRAME OF MIND
JEAN VALJEAN'S COMPOSURE WAS ONE OF THOSE POWERFUL TRANQUILLITIES WHICH ARE CONTAGIOUS
WHAT REMAINED TO BE DONE WAS A MERE NOTHING
HE PLAYED WITH FATHER MESTIENNE
HE DID WHAT HE LIKED WITH HIM HE MADE HIM DANCE ACCORDING TO HIS WHIM
THE PERMISSION FOR INTERMENT MUST BE EXHIBITED
HE WAS A SORT OF LABORING MAN WHO WORE A WAISTCOAT WITH LARGE POCKETS AND CARRIED A MATTOCK UNDER HIS ARM
THE MAN REPLIED THE GRAVE DIGGER
THE GRAVE DIGGER YES
YOU I
FATHER MESTIENNE IS THE GRAVE DIGGER HE WAS
FAUCHELEVENT HAD EXPECTED ANYTHING BUT THIS THAT A GRAVE DIGGER COULD DIE
IT IS TRUE NEVERTHELESS THAT GRAVE DIGGERS DO DIE THEMSELVES
HE HAD HARDLY THE STRENGTH TO STAMMER
BUT HE PERSISTED FEEBLY FATHER MESTIENNE IS THE GRAVE DIGGER
DO YOU KNOW WHO LITTLE FATHER LENOIR IS HE IS A JUG OF RED WINE
BUT YOU ARE A JOLLY FELLOW TOO
ARE YOU NOT COMRADE WE'LL GO AND HAVE A DRINK TOGETHER PRESENTLY
THE MAN REPLIED
HE LIMPED MORE OUT OF ANXIETY THAN FROM INFIRMITY
THE GRAVE DIGGER WALKED ON IN FRONT OF HIM
FAUCHELEVENT PASSED THE UNEXPECTED GRIBIER ONCE MORE IN REVIEW
FAUCHELEVENT WHO WAS ILLITERATE BUT VERY SHARP UNDERSTOOD THAT HE HAD TO DEAL WITH A FORMIDABLE SPECIES OF MAN WITH A FINE TALKER HE MUTTERED
SO FATHER MESTIENNE IS DEAD
THE MAN REPLIED COMPLETELY
THE GOOD GOD CONSULTED HIS NOTE BOOK WHICH SHOWS WHEN THE TIME IS UP IT WAS FATHER MESTIENNE'S TURN FATHER MESTIENNE DIED
STAMMERED FAUCHELEVENT IT IS MADE
YOU ARE A PEASANT I AM A PARISIAN
FAUCHELEVENT THOUGHT I AM LOST
THEY WERE ONLY A FEW TURNS OF THE WHEEL DISTANT FROM THE SMALL ALLEY LEADING TO THE NUNS CORNER
AND HE ADDED WITH THE SATISFACTION OF A SERIOUS MAN WHO IS TURNING A PHRASE WELL
FORTUNATELY THE SOIL WHICH WAS LIGHT AND WET WITH THE WINTER RAINS CLOGGED THE WHEELS AND RETARDED ITS SPEED
MY FATHER WAS A PORTER AT THE PRYTANEUM TOWN HALL
BUT HE HAD REVERSES HE HAD LOSSES ON CHANGE I WAS OBLIGED TO RENOUNCE THE PROFESSION OF AUTHOR BUT I AM STILL A PUBLIC WRITER
SO YOU ARE NOT A GRAVE DIGGER THEN
RETURNED FAUCHELEVENT CLUTCHING AT THIS BRANCH FEEBLE AS IT WAS
HERE A REMARK BECOMES NECESSARY
FAUCHELEVENT WHATEVER HIS ANGUISH OFFERED A DRINK BUT HE DID NOT EXPLAIN HIMSELF ON ONE POINT WHO WAS TO PAY
THE GRAVE DIGGER WENT ON WITH A SUPERIOR SMILE
ONE MUST EAT
OL MISTAH BUZZARD GRINNED
THIS SOUNDED LIKE ANOTHER STORY
HE WAS CURIOUS ABOUT THAT BLACK HEADED COUSIN OF OL MISTAH BUZZARD VERY CURIOUS INDEED
ANYWAY HE WOULD FIND OUT
PLEASE MISTER BUZZARD PLEASE TELL US THE STORY HE BEGGED
NOW OL MISTAH BUZZARD IS NATURALLY GOOD NATURED AND ACCOMMODATING AND WHEN PETER BEGGED SO HARD HE JUST COULDN'T FIND IT IN HIS HEART TO REFUSE
WAY BACK IN THE DAYS WHEN GRANDPAP BUZZARD HAD HIS LIL FALLING OUT WITH OL KING EAGLE AND DONE FLY SO HIGH HE SCO'TCH THE FEATHERS OFFEN HIS HAID HE HAD A COUSIN DID GRANDPAP BUZZARD AND THIS COUSIN WAS JES NATURALLY LAZY AND NO COUNT
LIKE MOST NO COUNT PEOPLE HE USED TO MAKE A REGULAR NUISANCE OF HISSELF POKING HIS NOSE INTO EV'YBODY'S BUSINESS AND NEVER TENDING TO HIS OWN
WASN'T ANYTHING GOING ON THAT THIS TRIFLING MEMBER OF THE BUZZARD FAM'LY DIDN'T FIND OUT ABOUT AND MEDDLE IN HE COULD ASK MO QUESTIONS THAN PETER RABBIT CAN AN ANYBODY THAT CAN DO THAT HAS GOT TO ASK A LOT
EVERYBODY LOOKED AT PETER AND LAUGHED
SO WE UNS SIT ON THE CHIMNEY TOPS WHENEVER OL JACK FROST GETS TO STRAYING DOWN WHERE HE HAVE NO BUSINESS
ONE DAY THIS NO COUNT TRIFLING COUSIN OF GRANDPAP BUZZARD GET COLD IN HIS FEET
IT WAS ON A LIL OL HOUSE A LIL OL TUMBLE DOWN HOUSE
WHY HE JES STRETCH HIS FOOL HAID AS FAR DOWN THAT CHIMNEY AS HE CAN AN LISTEN AN LISTEN
BUT HE DON'T MIND THAT
WILL YO' ALLS PLEASE SPEAK A LIL LOUDER HE HOLLER DOWN THE CHIMNEY JES LIKE THAT
YES SAH SHE SHO'LY WAS PLUMB SCARED
THEY LIKE TO CHOKE THAT NO COUNT BUZZARD TO DEATH
WHEN HE GET HOME HE TRY AN TRY TO BRUSH THAT SOOT OFF BUT IT DONE GET INTO THE SKIN AN IT STAY THERE
A LITTLE SIGH OF SATISFACTION WENT AROUND THE CIRCLE OF LISTENERS
IT WAS JUST AS GOOD AS ONE OF GRANDFATHER FROG'S
THE DUKE COMES EVERY MORNING THEY WILL TELL HIM WHEN HE COMES THAT I AM ASLEEP AND PERHAPS HE WILL WAIT UNTIL I WAKE
YES BUT IF I SHOULD ALREADY ASK FOR SOMETHING WHAT
WELL DO IT FOR ME FOR I SWEAR TO YOU THAT I DON'T LOVE YOU AS THE OTHERS HAVE LOVED YOU
THERE ARE BOLTS ON THE DOOR WRETCH
I DON'T KNOW HOW IT IS BUT IT SEEMS TO ME AS IF I DO
NOW GO I CAN'T KEEP MY EYES OPEN
IT SEEMED TO ME AS IF THIS SLEEPING CITY BELONGED TO ME I SEARCHED MY MEMORY FOR THE NAMES OF THOSE WHOSE HAPPINESS I HAD ONCE ENVIED AND I COULD NOT RECALL ONE WITHOUT FINDING MYSELF THE HAPPIER
EDUCATION FAMILY FEELING THE SENSE OF DUTY THE FAMILY ARE STRONG SENTINELS BUT THERE ARE NO SENTINELS SO VIGILANT AS NOT TO BE DECEIVED BY A GIRL OF SIXTEEN TO WHOM NATURE BY THE VOICE OF THE MAN SHE LOVES GIVES THE FIRST COUNSELS OF LOVE ALL THE MORE ARDENT BECAUSE THEY SEEM SO PURE
THE MORE A GIRL BELIEVES IN GOODNESS THE MORE EASILY WILL SHE GIVE WAY IF NOT TO HER LOVER AT LEAST TO LOVE FOR BEING WITHOUT MISTRUST SHE IS WITHOUT FORCE AND TO WIN HER LOVE IS A TRIUMPH THAT CAN BE GAINED BY ANY YOUNG MAN OF FIVE AND TWENTY SEE HOW YOUNG GIRLS ARE WATCHED AND GUARDED
THEN HOW SURELY MUST THEY DESIRE THE WORLD WHICH IS HIDDEN FROM THEM HOW SURELY MUST THEY FIND IT TEMPTING HOW SURELY MUST THEY LISTEN TO THE FIRST VOICE WHICH COMES TO TELL ITS SECRETS THROUGH THEIR BARS AND BLESS THE HAND WHICH IS THE FIRST TO RAISE A CORNER OF THE MYSTERIOUS VEIL
WITH THEM THE BODY HAS WORN OUT THE SOUL THE SENSES HAVE BURNED UP THE HEART DISSIPATION HAS BLUNTED THE FEELINGS
THEY LOVE BY PROFESSION AND NOT BY INSTINCT
WHEN A CREATURE WHO HAS ALL HER PAST TO REPROACH HERSELF WITH IS TAKEN ALL AT ONCE BY A PROFOUND SINCERE IRRESISTIBLE LOVE OF WHICH SHE HAD NEVER FELT HERSELF CAPABLE WHEN SHE HAS CONFESSED HER LOVE HOW ABSOLUTELY THE MAN WHOM SHE LOVES DOMINATES HER
THEY KNOW NOT WHAT PROOF TO GIVE
IN ORDER TO DISTURB THE LABOURERS IN THE FIELD WAS ONE DAY DEVOURED BY A WOLF BECAUSE THOSE WHOM HE HAD SO OFTEN DECEIVED NO LONGER BELIEVED IN HIS CRIES FOR HELP
IT IS THE SAME WITH THESE UNHAPPY WOMEN WHEN THEY LOVE SERIOUSLY
BUT WHEN THE MAN WHO INSPIRES THIS REDEEMING LOVE IS GREAT ENOUGH IN SOUL TO RECEIVE IT WITHOUT REMEMBERING THE PAST WHEN HE GIVES HIMSELF UP TO IT WHEN IN SHORT HE LOVES AS HE IS LOVED THIS MAN DRAINS AT ONE DRAUGHT ALL EARTHLY EMOTIONS AND AFTER SUCH A LOVE HIS HEART WILL BE CLOSED TO EVERY OTHER
BUT TO RETURN TO THE FIRST DAY OF MY LIAISON
WHEN I REACHED HOME I WAS IN A STATE OF MAD GAIETY
THE WOMAN BECOMES THE MAN'S MISTRESS AND LOVES HIM
HOW WHY
MY WHOLE BEING WAS EXALTED INTO JOY AT THE MEMORY OF THE WORDS WE HAD EXCHANGED DURING THAT FIRST NIGHT
HERE ARE MY ORDERS TO NIGHT AT THE VAUDEVILLE
COME DURING THE THIRD ENTR'ACTE
THE BOXES FILLED ONE AFTER ANOTHER
ONLY ONE REMAINED EMPTY THE STAGE BOX
AT THE BEGINNING OF THE THIRD ACT I HEARD THE DOOR OF THE BOX ON WHICH MY EYES HAD BEEN ALMOST CONSTANTLY FIXED OPEN AND MARGUERITE APPEARED
DID SHE LOVE ME ENOUGH TO BELIEVE THAT THE MORE BEAUTIFUL SHE LOOKED THE HAPPIER I SHOULD BE
WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH YOU TO NIGHT SAID MARGUERITE RISING AND COMING TO THE BACK OF THE BOX AND KISSING ME ON THE FOREHEAD
YOU SHOULD GO TO BED SHE REPLIED WITH THAT IRONICAL AIR WHICH WENT SO WELL WITH HER DELICATE AND WITTY FACE
WHERE AT HOME
YOU STILL LOVE ME CAN YOU ASK
BECAUSE YOU DON'T LIKE SEEING HIM
NONETHELESS I WAS VERY UNHAPPY ALL THE REST OF THE EVENING AND WENT AWAY VERY SADLY AFTER HAVING SEEN PRUDENCE THE COUNT AND MARGUERITE GET INTO THE CARRIAGE WHICH WAS WAITING FOR THEM AT THE DOOR
I HAVE NOT COME TO HINDER YOU FROM LEAVING PARIS
YOU IN THE WAY MARGUERITE BUT HOW
WELL YOU MIGHT HAVE HAD A WOMAN HERE SAID PRUDENCE AND IT WOULD HARDLY HAVE BEEN AMUSING FOR HER TO SEE TWO MORE ARRIVE
DURING THIS REMARK MARGUERITE LOOKED AT ME ATTENTIVELY
MY DEAR PRUDENCE I ANSWERED YOU DO NOT KNOW WHAT YOU ARE SAYING
YES BUT BESIDES NOT WISHING TO PUT YOU OUT I WAS SURE THAT IF YOU CAME AS FAR AS MY DOOR YOU WOULD WANT TO COME UP AND AS I COULD NOT LET YOU I DID NOT WISH TO LET YOU GO AWAY BLAMING ME FOR SAYING NO
BECAUSE I AM WATCHED AND THE LEAST SUSPICION MIGHT DO ME THE GREATEST HARM
IS THAT REALLY THE ONLY REASON
IF THERE WERE ANY OTHER I WOULD TELL YOU FOR WE ARE NOT TO HAVE ANY SECRETS FROM ONE ANOTHER NOW
HONESTLY DO YOU CARE FOR ME A LITTLE A GREAT DEAL
I FANCIED FOR A MOMENT THAT I MIGHT GIVE MYSELF THAT HAPPINESS FOR SIX MONTHS YOU WOULD NOT HAVE IT YOU INSISTED ON KNOWING THE MEANS
WELL GOOD HEAVENS THE MEANS WERE EASY ENOUGH TO GUESS
I LISTENED AND I GAZED AT MARGUERITE WITH ADMIRATION
WHEN I THOUGHT THAT THIS MARVELLOUS CREATURE WHOSE FEET I HAD ONCE LONGED TO KISS WAS WILLING TO LET ME TAKE MY PLACE IN HER THOUGHTS MY PART IN HER LIFE AND THAT I WAS NOT YET CONTENT WITH WHAT SHE GAVE ME I ASKED IF MAN'S DESIRE HAS INDEED LIMITS WHEN SATISFIED AS PROMPTLY AS MINE HAD BEEN IT REACHED AFTER SOMETHING FURTHER
TRULY SHE CONTINUED WE POOR CREATURES OF CHANCE HAVE FANTASTIC DESIRES AND INCONCEIVABLE LOVES
WE ARE NOT ALLOWED TO HAVE HEARTS UNDER PENALTY OF BEING HOOTED DOWN AND OF RUINING OUR CREDIT
WE NO LONGER BELONG TO OURSELVES
WE STAND FIRST IN THEIR SELF ESTEEM LAST IN THEIR ESTEEM
NEVER DO THEY GIVE YOU ADVICE WHICH IS NOT LUCRATIVE
IT MEANS LITTLE ENOUGH TO THEM THAT WE SHOULD HAVE TEN LOVERS EXTRA AS LONG AS THEY GET DRESSES OR A BRACELET OUT OF THEM AND THAT THEY CAN DRIVE IN OUR CARRIAGE FROM TIME TO TIME OR COME TO OUR BOX AT THE THEATRE
SUCH A MAN I FOUND IN THE DUKE BUT THE DUKE IS OLD AND OLD AGE NEITHER PROTECTS NOR CONSOLES
I THOUGHT I COULD ACCEPT THE LIFE WHICH HE OFFERED ME BUT WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE
WHAT I LOVED IN YOU WAS NOT THE MAN WHO WAS BUT THE MAN WHO WAS GOING TO BE
MARGUERITE TIRED OUT WITH THIS LONG CONFESSION THREW HERSELF BACK ON THE SOFA AND TO STIFLE A SLIGHT COUGH PUT UP HER HANDKERCHIEF TO HER LIPS AND FROM THAT TO HER EYES
MARGUERITE DO WITH ME AS YOU WILL I AM YOUR SLAVE YOUR DOG BUT IN THE NAME OF HEAVEN TEAR UP THE LETTER WHICH I WROTE TO YOU AND DO NOT MAKE ME LEAVE YOU TO MORROW IT WOULD KILL ME
MARGUERITE DREW THE LETTER FROM HER BOSOM AND HANDING IT TO ME WITH A SMILE OF INFINITE SWEETNESS SAID
HERE IT IS I HAVE BROUGHT IT BACK
I TORE THE LETTER INTO FRAGMENTS AND KISSED WITH TEARS THE HAND THAT GAVE IT TO ME
LOOK HERE PRUDENCE DO YOU KNOW WHAT HE WANTS SAID MARGUERITE
HE WANTS YOU TO FORGIVE HIM
ONE HAS TO BUT HE WANTS MORE THAN THAT WHAT THEN
I EMBRACED MARGUERITE UNTIL SHE WAS ALMOST STIFLED
AS I THOUGHT THAT THIS WAS DUE TO SOME FAULT IN THE EARTH I WANTED TO MAKE THESE FIRST EXPERIMENTS BEFORE I UNDERTOOK MY PERSEUS
WHEN I SAW THAT THIS BUST CAME OUT SHARP AND CLEAN I SET AT ONCE TO CONSTRUCT A LITTLE FURNACE IN THE WORKSHOP ERECTED FOR ME BY THE DUKE AFTER MY OWN PLANS AND DESIGN IN THE HOUSE WHICH THE DUKE HAD GIVEN ME
IT WAS AN EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TASK AND I WAS ANXIOUS TO OBSERVE ALL THE NICETIES OF ART WHICH I HAD LEARNED SO AS NOT TO LAPSE INTO SOME ERROR
I IN MY TURN FEEL THE SAME DESIRE AND HOPE TO PLAY MY PART LIKE THEM THEREFORE MY LORD GIVE ME THE LEAVE TO GO
BUT BEWARE OF LETTING BANDINELLO QUIT YOU RATHER BESTOW UPON HIM ALWAYS MORE THAN HE DEMANDS FOR IF HE GOES INTO FOREIGN PARTS HIS IGNORANCE IS SO PRESUMPTUOUS THAT HE IS JUST THE MAN TO DISGRACE OUR MOST ILLUSTRIOUS SCHOOL
I ASK NO FURTHER REWARD FOR MY LABOURS UP TO THIS TIME THAN THE GRACIOUS FAVOUR OF YOUR MOST ILLUSTRIOUS EXCELLENCY
THEN I THANKED HIM AND SAID I HAD NO GREATER DESIRE THAN TO SHOW THOSE ENVIOUS FOLK THAT I HAD IT IN ME TO EXECUTE THE PROMISED WORK
I HAD BETTER LOOK TO MY CONDUCT FOR IT HAD COME TO HIS EARS THAT I RELIED UPON HIS FAVOUR TO TAKE IN FIRST ONE MAN AND THEN ANOTHER
I BEGGED HIS MOST ILLUSTRIOUS EXCELLENCY TO NAME A SINGLE PERSON WHOM I HAD EVER TAKEN IN
I SAID MY LORD I THANK YOU AND BEG YOU TO CONDESCEND SO FAR AS TO LISTEN TO FOUR WORDS IT IS TRUE THAT HE LENT ME A PAIR OF OLD SCALES TWO ANVILS AND THREE LITTLE HAMMERS WHICH ARTICLES I BEGGED HIS WORKMAN GIORGIO DA CORTONA FIFTEEN DAYS AGO TO FETCH BACK
GIORGIO CAME FOR THEM HIMSELF
I HOPE TO PROVE ON WHAT ACCOUNT THAT SCOUNDREL TRIES TO BRING ME INTO DISGRACE
WHEN HE HAD HEARD THIS SPEECH THE DUKE ROSE UP IN ANGER AND SENT FOR BERNARDONE WHO WAS FORCED TO TAKE FLIGHT AS FAR AS VENICE HE AND ANTONIO LANDI WITH HIM
YOU HAD BETTER PUT THIS TO THE PROOF AND I WILL GO AT ONCE TO THE BARGELLO
I AM WILLING TO ENTER INTO COMPETITION WITH THE ANCIENTS AND FEEL ABLE TO SURPASS THEM FOR SINCE THOSE EARLY DAYS IN WHICH I MADE THE MEDALS OF POPE CLEMENT I HAVE LEARNED SO MUCH THAT I CAN NOW PRODUCE FAR BETTER PIECES OF THE KIND I THINK I CAN ALSO OUTDO THE COINS I STRUCK FOR DUKE ALESSANDRO WHICH ARE STILL HELD IN HIGH ESTEEM IN LIKE MANNER I COULD MAKE FOR YOU LARGE PIECES OF GOLD AND SILVER PLATE AS I DID SO OFTEN FOR THAT NOBLE MONARCH KING FRANCIS OF FRANCE THANKS TO THE GREAT CONVENIENCES HE ALLOWED ME WITHOUT EVER LOSING TIME FOR THE EXECUTION OF COLOSSAL STATUES OR OTHER WORKS OF THE SCULPTORS CRAFT
AFTER SEVERAL MONTHS WERE WASTED AND PIERO WOULD NEITHER WORK NOR PUT MEN TO WORK UPON THE PIECE I MADE HIM GIVE IT BACK
AMONG ARTISTS CERTAIN ENRAGED SCULPTORS LAUGHED AT ME AND CALLED ME THE NEW SCULPTOR
NOW I HOPE TO SHOW THEM THAT I AM AN OLD SCULPTOR IF GOD SHALL GRANT ME THE BOON OF FINISHING MY PERSEUS FOR THAT NOBLE PIAZZA OF HIS MOST ILLUSTRIOUS EXCELLENCY
HAVING THIS EXCELLENT RESOLVE IN HEART I REACHED MY HOME
BUT THE MIDDLE SON WAS LITTLE AND LORN HE WAS NEITHER DARK NOR FAIR HE WAS NEITHER HANDSOME NOR STRONG
THROWING HIMSELF ON HIS KNEES BEFORE THE KING HE CRIED OH ROYAL SIRE BESTOW UPON ME ALSO A SWORD AND A STEED THAT I MAY UP AND AWAY TO FOLLOW MY BRETHREN
BUT THE KING LAUGHED HIM TO SCORN THOU A SWORD HE QUOTH
IN SOOTH THOU SHALT HAVE ONE BUT IT SHALL BE ONE BEFITTING THY MAIDEN SIZE AND COURAGE IF SO SMALL A WEAPON CAN BE FOUND IN ALL MY KINGDOM
FORTHWITH THE GRINNING JESTER BEGAN SHRIEKING WITH LAUGHTER SO THAT THE BELLS UPON HIS MOTLEY CAP WERE ALL SET A JANGLING
I DID BUT LAUGH TO THINK THE SWORD OF ETHELRIED HAD BEEN SO QUICKLY FOUND RESPONDED THE JESTER AND HE POINTED TO THE SCISSORS HANGING FROM THE TAILOR'S GIRDLE
ONE NIGHT AS HE LAY IN A DEEP FOREST TOO UNHAPPY TO SLEEP HE HEARD A NOISE NEAR AT HAND IN THE BUSHES
THOU SHALT HAVE THY LIBERTY HE CRIED EVEN THOUGH THOU SHOULDST REND ME IN PIECES THE MOMENT THOU ART FREE
IT HAD SUDDENLY DISAPPEARED AND IN ITS PLACE STOOD A BEAUTIFUL FAIRY WITH FILMY WINGS WHICH SHONE LIKE RAINBOWS IN THE MOONLIGHT
AT THIS MOMENT THERE WAS A DISTANT RUMBLING AS OF THUNDER TIS THE OGRE CRIED THE FAIRY WE MUST HASTEN
SCISSORS GROW A GIANT'S HEIGHT AND SAVE US FROM THE OGRE'S MIGHT
HE COULD SEE THE OGRE STANDING POWERLESS TO HURT HIM ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE CHASM AND GNASHING HIS TEETH EACH ONE OF WHICH WAS AS BIG AS A MILLSTON
THE SIGHT WAS SO TERRIBLE THAT HE TURNED ON HIS HEEL AND FLED AWAY AS FAST AS HIS FEET COULD CARRY HIM
THOU SHALT NOT BE LEFT A PRISONER IN THIS DISMAL SPOT WHILE I HAVE THE POWER TO HELP THEE
HE LIFTED THE SCISSORS AND WITH ONE STROKE DESTROYED THE WEB AND GAVE THE FLY ITS FREEDOM
A FAINT GLIMMER OF LIGHT ON THE OPPOSITE WALL SHOWS ME THE KEYHOLE
THE PRINCE SPENT ALL THE FOLLOWING TIME UNTIL MIDNIGHT TRYING TO THINK OF A SUITABLE VERSE TO SAY TO THE SCISSORS
AS HE UTTERED THE WORDS THE SCISSORS LEAPED OUT OF HIS HAND AND BEGAN TO CUT THROUGH THE WOODEN SHUTTERS AS EASILY AS THROUGH A CHEESE
IN A VERY SHORT TIME THE PRINCE HAD CRAWLED THROUGH THE OPENING
WHILE HE STOOD LOOKING AROUND HIM IN BEWILDERMENT A FIREFLY ALIGHTED ON HIS ARM FLASHING ITS LITTLE LANTERN IN THE PRINCE'S FACE IT CRIED THIS WAY MY FRIEND THE FLY SENT ME TO GUIDE YOU TO A PLACE OF SAFETY
WHAT IS TO BECOME OF ME CRIED THE POOR PEASANT
MY GRAIN MUST FALL AND ROT IN THE FIELD FROM OVERRIPENESS BECAUSE I HAVE NOT THE STRENGTH TO RISE AND HARVEST IT THEN INDEED MUST WE ALL STARVE
THE GRANDAME WHOM HE SUPPLIED WITH FAGOTS THE MERCHANT WHOM HE RESCUED FROM ROBBERS THE KING'S COUNCILLOR TO WHOM HE GAVE AID ALL BECAME HIS FRIENDS UP AND DOWN THE LAND TO BEGGAR OR LORD HOMELESS WANDERER OR HIGH BORN DAME HE GLADLY GAVE UNSELFISH SERVICE ALL UNSOUGHT AND SUCH AS HE HELPED STRAIGHTWAY BECAME HIS FRIENDS
TO HIM WHO COULD BRING HER BACK TO HER FATHER'S CASTLE SHOULD BE GIVEN THE THRONE AND KINGDOM AS WELL AS THE PRINCESS HERSELF SO FROM FAR AND NEAR INDEED FROM ALMOST EVERY COUNTRY UNDER THE SUN CAME KNIGHTS AND PRINCES TO FIGHT THE OGRE
AMONG THOSE WHO DREW BACK WERE ETHELRIED'S BROTHERS THE THREE THAT WERE DARK AND THE THREE THAT WERE FAIR
BUT ETHELRIED HEEDED NOT THEIR TAUNTS
SO THEY ALL CRIED OUT LONG AND LOUD LONG LIVE THE PRINCE PRINCE CISEAUX
HE FELT WHAT THE EARTH MAY POSSIBLY FEEL AT THE MOMENT WHEN IT IS TORN OPEN WITH THE IRON IN ORDER THAT GRAIN MAY BE DEPOSITED WITHIN IT IT FEELS ONLY THE WOUND THE QUIVER OF THE GERM AND THE JOY OF THE FRUIT ONLY ARRIVE LATER
HE HAD BUT JUST ACQUIRED A FAITH MUST HE THEN REJECT IT ALREADY
HE AFFIRMED TO HIMSELF THAT HE WOULD NOT HE DECLARED TO HIMSELF THAT HE WOULD NOT DOUBT AND HE BEGAN TO DOUBT IN SPITE OF HIMSELF
TO STAND BETWEEN TWO RELIGIONS FROM ONE OF WHICH YOU HAVE NOT AS YET EMERGED AND ANOTHER INTO WHICH YOU HAVE NOT YET ENTERED IS INTOLERABLE AND TWILIGHT IS PLEASING ONLY TO BAT LIKE SOULS
MARIUS WAS CLEAR EYED AND HE REQUIRED THE TRUE LIGHT
THE HALF LIGHTS OF DOUBT PAINED HIM
WHATEVER MAY HAVE BEEN HIS DESIRE TO REMAIN WHERE HE WAS HE COULD NOT HALT THERE HE WAS IRRESISTIBLY CONSTRAINED TO CONTINUE TO ADVANCE TO EXAMINE TO THINK TO MARCH FURTHER
HE FEARED AFTER HAVING TAKEN SO MANY STEPS WHICH HAD BROUGHT HIM NEARER TO HIS FATHER TO NOW TAKE A STEP WHICH SHOULD ESTRANGE HIM FROM THAT FATHER
HIS DISCOMFORT WAS AUGMENTED BY ALL THE REFLECTIONS WHICH OCCURRED TO HIM
IN THE TROUBLED STATE OF HIS CONSCIENCE HE NO LONGER THOUGHT OF CERTAIN SERIOUS SIDES OF EXISTENCE
THEY SOON ELBOWED HIM ABRUPTLY
REQUEST COURFEYRAC TO COME AND TALK WITH ME SAID MARIUS
WHAT IS TO BECOME OF YOU SAID COURFEYRAC
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO I DO NOT KNOW
SILVER GOLD HERE IT IS
YOU WILL THEN HAVE ONLY A PAIR OF TROUSERS A WAISTCOAT A HAT AND A COAT AND MY BOOTS
THAT WILL BE ENOUGH
NO IT IS NOT GOOD WHAT WILL YOU DO AFTER THAT
DO YOU KNOW GERMAN NO
IT IS BADLY PAID WORK BUT ONE CAN LIVE BY IT
THE CLOTHES DEALER WAS SENT FOR
HE PAID TWENTY FRANCS FOR THE CAST OFF GARMENTS THEY WENT TO THE WATCHMAKER'S
HE BOUGHT THE WATCH FOR FORTY FIVE FRANCS
HELLO I HAD FORGOTTEN THAT SAID MARIUS
THE LANDLORD PRESENTED HIS BILL WHICH HAD TO BE PAID ON THE SPOT
I HAVE TEN FRANCS LEFT SAID MARIUS
THAT WILL BE SWALLOWING A TONGUE VERY FAST OR A HUNDRED SOUS VERY SLOWLY
ONE MORNING ON HIS RETURN FROM THE LAW SCHOOL MARIUS FOUND A LETTER FROM HIS AUNT AND THE SIXTY PISTOLES THAT IS TO SAY SIX HUNDRED FRANCS IN GOLD IN A SEALED BOX
MARIUS SENT BACK THE THIRTY LOUIS TO HIS AUNT WITH A RESPECTFUL LETTER IN WHICH HE STATED THAT HE HAD SUFFICIENT MEANS OF SUBSISTENCE AND THAT HE SHOULD BE ABLE THENCEFORTH TO SUPPLY ALL HIS NEEDS
AT THAT MOMENT HE HAD THREE FRANCS LEFT
WYLDER WAS RATHER SURLY AFTER THE LADIES HAD FLOATED AWAY FROM THE SCENE AND HE DRANK HIS LIQUOR DOGGEDLY
IT WAS HIS FANCY I SUPPOSE TO REVIVE CERTAIN SENTIMENTAL RELATIONS WHICH HAD IT MAY BE ONCE EXISTED BETWEEN HIM AND MISS LAKE AND HE WAS A PERSON OF THAT COMBATIVE TEMPERAMENT THAT MAGNIFIES AN OBJECT IN PROPORTION AS ITS PURSUIT IS THWARTED
THE STORY OF FRIDOLIN AND RETZCH'S PRETTY OUTLINES
SIT DOWN BESIDE ME AND I'LL TELL YOU THE STORY
HE ASSISTED AT IT BUT TOOK NO PART AND IN FACT WAS LISTENING TO THAT OTHER CONVERSATION WHICH SOUNDED WITH ITS PLEASANT GABBLE AND LAUGHTER LIKE A LITTLE MUSICAL TINKLE OF BELLS IN THE DISTANCE
BUT HONEST MARK FORGOT THAT YOUNG LADIES DO NOT ALWAYS COME OUT QUITE ALONE AND JUMP UNASSISTED INTO THEIR VEHICLES
THERE'S IRON THEY SAY IN ALL OUR BLOOD AND A GRAIN OR TWO PERHAPS IS GOOD BUT HIS HE MAKES ME HARSHLY FEEL HAS GOT A LITTLE TOO MUCH OF STEEL ANON
MARGARET SAID MISTER HALE AS HE RETURNED FROM SHOWING HIS GUEST DOWNSTAIRS I COULD NOT HELP WATCHING YOUR FACE WITH SOME ANXIETY WHEN MISTER THORNTON MADE HIS CONFESSION OF HAVING BEEN A SHOP BOY
YOU DON'T MEAN THAT YOU THOUGHT ME SO SILLY
I REALLY LIKED THAT ACCOUNT OF HIMSELF BETTER THAN ANYTHING ELSE HE SAID
HIS STATEMENT OF HAVING BEEN A SHOP BOY WAS THE THING I LIKED BEST OF ALL
YOU WHO WERE ALWAYS ACCUSING PEOPLE OF BEING SHOPPY AT HELSTONE
I DON'T THINK MISTER HALE YOU HAVE DONE QUITE RIGHT IN INTRODUCING SUCH A PERSON TO US WITHOUT TELLING US WHAT HE HAD BEEN
I REALLY WAS VERY MUCH AFRAID OF SHOWING HIM HOW MUCH SHOCKED I WAS AT SOME PARTS OF WHAT HE SAID
HIS FATHER DYING IN MISERABLE CIRCUMSTANCES
WHY IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN IN THE WORKHOUSE
HIS FATHER SPECULATED WILDLY FAILED AND THEN KILLED HIMSELF BECAUSE HE COULD NOT BEAR THE DISGRACE
ALL HIS FORMER FRIENDS SHRUNK FROM THE DISCLOSURES THAT HAD TO BE MADE OF HIS DISHONEST GAMBLING WILD HOPELESS STRUGGLES MADE WITH OTHER PEOPLE'S MONEY TO REGAIN HIS OWN MODERATE PORTION OF WEALTH
NO ONE CAME FORWARDS TO HELP THE MOTHER AND THIS BOY
AT LEAST NO FRIEND CAME FORWARDS IMMEDIATELY AND MISSUS THORNTON IS NOT ONE I FANCY TO WAIT TILL TARDY KINDNESS COMES TO FIND HER OUT
SO THEY LEFT MILTON
HOW TAINTED ASKED HER FATHER
OH PAPA BY THAT TESTING EVERYTHING BY THE STANDARD OF WEALTH
WHEN HE SPOKE OF THE MECHANICAL POWERS HE EVIDENTLY LOOKED UPON THEM ONLY AS NEW WAYS OF EXTENDING TRADE AND MAKING MONEY
AND THE POOR MEN AROUND HIM THEY WERE POOR BECAUSE THEY WERE VICIOUS OUT OF THE PALE OF HIS SYMPATHIES BECAUSE THEY HAD NOT HIS IRON NATURE AND THE CAPABILITIES THAT IT GIVES HIM FOR BEING RICH
NOT VICIOUS HE NEVER SAID THAT
IMPROVIDENT AND SELF INDULGENT WERE HIS WORDS
MARGARET WAS COLLECTING HER MOTHER'S WORKING MATERIALS AND PREPARING TO GO TO BED
JUST AS SHE WAS LEAVING THE ROOM SHE HESITATED SHE WAS INCLINED TO MAKE AN ACKNOWLEDGMENT WHICH SHE THOUGHT WOULD PLEASE HER FATHER BUT WHICH TO BE FULL AND TRUE MUST INCLUDE A LITTLE ANNOYANCE
HOWEVER OUT IT CAME
PAPA I DO THINK MISTER THORNTON A VERY REMARKABLE MAN BUT PERSONALLY I DON'T LIKE HIM AT ALL
AND I DO SAID HER FATHER LAUGHING
PERSONALLY AS YOU CALL IT AND ALL
I DON'T SET HIM UP FOR A HERO OR ANYTHING OF THAT KIND
BUT GOOD NIGHT CHILD
THERE WERE SEVERAL OTHER SIGNS OF SOMETHING WRONG ABOUT MISSUS HALE
SHE AND DIXON HELD MYSTERIOUS CONSULTATIONS IN HER BEDROOM FROM WHICH DIXON WOULD COME OUT CRYING AND CROSS AS WAS HER CUSTOM WHEN ANY DISTRESS OF HER MISTRESS CALLED UPON HER SYMPATHY
ONCE MARGARET HAD GONE INTO THE CHAMBER SOON AFTER DIXON LEFT IT AND FOUND HER MOTHER ON HER KNEES AND AS MARGARET STOLE OUT SHE CAUGHT A FEW WORDS WHICH WERE EVIDENTLY A PRAYER FOR STRENGTH AND PATIENCE TO ENDURE SEVERE BODILY SUFFERING
BUT THOUGH SHE RECEIVED CARESSES AND FOND WORDS BACK AGAIN IN SUCH PROFUSION AS WOULD HAVE GLADDENED HER FORMERLY YET SHE FELT THAT THERE WAS A SECRET WITHHELD FROM HER AND SHE BELIEVED IT BORE SERIOUS REFERENCE TO HER MOTHER'S HEALTH
SHE LAY AWAKE VERY LONG THIS NIGHT PLANNING HOW TO LESSEN THE EVIL INFLUENCE OF THEIR MILTON LIFE ON HER MOTHER
A SERVANT TO GIVE DIXON PERMANENT ASSISTANCE SHOULD BE GOT IF SHE GAVE UP HER WHOLE TIME TO THE SEARCH AND THEN AT ANY RATE HER MOTHER MIGHT HAVE ALL THE PERSONAL ATTENTION SHE REQUIRED AND HAD BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO HER WHOLE LIFE
VISITING REGISTER OFFICES SEEING ALL MANNER OF UNLIKELY PEOPLE AND VERY FEW IN THE LEAST LIKELY ABSORBED MARGARET'S TIME AND THOUGHTS FOR SEVERAL DAYS
ONE AFTERNOON SHE MET BESSY HIGGINS IN THE STREET AND STOPPED TO SPEAK TO HER
WELL BESSY HOW ARE YOU
BETTER AND NOT BETTER IF YO KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS
NOT EXACTLY REPLIED MARGARET SMILING
I'M BETTER IN NOT BEING TORN TO PIECES BY COUGHING O'NIGHTS BUT I'M WEARY AND TIRED O MILTON AND LONGING TO GET AWAY TO THE LAND O BEULAH AND WHEN I THINK I'M FARTHER AND FARTHER OFF MY HEART SINKS AND I'M NO BETTER I'M WORSE
MARGARET TURNED ROUND TO WALK ALONGSIDE OF THE GIRL IN HER FEEBLE PROGRESS HOMEWARD
BUT FOR A MINUTE OR TWO SHE DID NOT SPEAK
AT LAST SHE SAID IN A LOW VOICE
BESSY DO YOU WISH TO DIE
BESSY WAS SILENT IN HER TURN FOR A MINUTE OR TWO THEN SHE REPLIED
NOUGHT WORSE THAN MANY OTHERS I RECKON
BUT WHAT WAS IT
YOU KNOW I'M A STRANGER HERE SO PERHAPS I'M NOT SO QUICK AT UNDERSTANDING WHAT YOU MEAN AS IF I'D LIVED ALL MY LIFE AT MILTON
I HAD FORGOTTEN WHAT I SAID FOR THE TIME CONTINUED MARGARET QUIETLY
I SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT OF IT AGAIN WHEN I WAS LESS BUSY MAY I GO WITH YOU NOW
THE SHARPNESS IN HER EYE TURNED TO A WISTFUL LONGING AS SHE MET MARGARET'S SOFT AND FRIENDLY GAZE
AS THEY TURNED UP INTO A SMALL COURT OPENING OUT OF A SQUALID STREET BESSY SAID
YO'LL NOT BE DAUNTED IF FATHER'S AT HOME AND SPEAKS A BIT GRUFFISH AT FIRST
BUT NICHOLAS WAS NOT AT HOME WHEN THEY ENTERED
GASPED BESSY AT LAST
BESSY TOOK A LONG AND FEVERISH DRAUGHT AND THEN FELL BACK AND SHUT HER EYES
MARGARET BENT OVER AND SAID BESSY DON'T BE IMPATIENT WITH YOUR LIFE WHATEVER IT IS OR MAY HAVE BEEN
REMEMBER WHO GAVE IT YOU AND MADE IT WHAT IT IS
NOW I'LL NOT HAVE MY WENCH PREACHED TO
BUT SURELY SAID MARGARET FACING ROUND YOU BELIEVE IN WHAT I SAID THAT GOD GAVE HER LIFE AND ORDERED WHAT KIND OF LIFE IT WAS TO BE
I BELIEVE WHAT I SEE AND NO MORE
THAT'S WHAT I BELIEVE YOUNG WOMAN
I DON'T BELIEVE ALL I HEAR NO NOT BY A BIG DEAL
BUT HOO'S COME AT LAST AND HOO'S WELCOME AS LONG AS HOO'LL KEEP FROM PREACHING ON WHAT HOO KNOWS NOUGHT ABOUT
IT'S SIMPLE AND NOT FAR TO FETCH NOR HARD TO WORK
BUT THE GIRL ONLY PLEADED THE MORE WITH MARGARET
DON'T THINK HARDLY ON HIM HE'S A GOOD MAN HE IS
I SOMETIMES THINK I SHALL BE MOPED WI SORROW EVEN IN THE CITY OF GOD IF FATHER IS NOT THERE
THE FEVERISH COLOUR CAME INTO HER CHEEK AND THE FEVERISH FLAME INTO HER EYE
BUT YOU WILL BE THERE FATHER YOU SHALL OH MY HEART
SHE PUT HER HAND TO IT AND BECAME GHASTLY PALE
MARGARET HELD HER IN HER ARMS AND PUT THE WEARY HEAD TO REST UPON HER BOSOM
PRESENTLY THE SPASM THAT FORESHADOWED DEATH HAD PASSED AWAY AND BESSY ROUSED HERSELF AND SAID
I'LL GO TO BED IT'S BEST PLACE BUT CATCHING AT MARGARET'S GOWN YO'LL COME AGAIN I KNOW YO WILL BUT JUST SAY IT
I WILL COME TO MORROW SAID MARGARET
MARGARET WENT AWAY VERY SAD AND THOUGHTFUL
SHE WAS LATE FOR TEA AT HOME
HAVE YOU MET WITH A SERVANT DEAR
NO MAMMA THAT ANNE BUCKLEY WOULD NEVER HAVE DONE
SUPPOSE I TRY SAID MISTER HALE
EVERYBODY ELSE HAS HAD THEIR TURN AT THIS GREAT DIFFICULTY NOW LET ME TRY
I MAY BE THE CINDERELLA TO PUT ON THE SLIPPER AFTER ALL
WHAT WOULD YOU DO PAPA HOW WOULD YOU SET ABOUT IT
WHY I WOULD APPLY TO SOME GOOD HOUSE MOTHER TO RECOMMEND ME ONE KNOWN TO HERSELF OR HER SERVANTS
VERY GOOD BUT WE MUST FIRST CATCH OUR HOUSE MOTHER
THE MOTHER OF WHOM HE SPOKE TO US SAID MARGARET
MISSUS THORNTON THE ONLY MOTHER HE HAS I BELIEVE SAID MISTER HALE QUIETLY
I SHALL LIKE TO SEE HER SHE MUST BE AN UNCOMMON PERSON HER MOTHER ADDED
PERHAPS SHE MAY HAVE A RELATION WHO MIGHT SUIT US AND BE GLAD OF OUR PLACE
SHE SOUNDED TO BE SUCH A CAREFUL ECONOMICAL PERSON THAT I SHOULD LIKE ANY ONE OUT OF THE SAME FAMILY
MY DEAR SAID MISTER HALE ALARMED PRAY DON'T GO OFF ON THAT IDEA
I AM SURE AT ANY RATE SHE WOULD NOT LIKE STRANGERS TO KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT
TAKE NOTICE THAT IS NOT MY KIND OF HAUGHTINESS PAPA IF I HAVE ANY AT ALL WHICH I DON'T AGREE TO THOUGH YOU'RE ALWAYS ACCUSING ME OF IT
I DON'T KNOW POSITIVELY THAT IT IS HERS EITHER BUT FROM LITTLE THINGS I HAVE GATHERED FROM HIM I FANCY SO
THEY CARED TOO LITTLE TO ASK IN WHAT MANNER HER SON HAD SPOKEN ABOUT HER
THEY WENT DOWN TO THEIR QUARTERS FIRST
GUESS MISTER FINNEY WENT TO HIS QUARTERS I DON'T REMEMBER SEEING HIM CROSS THE DECK OR COME OVER THAT WAY AT ALL
NEXT NED CILLEY WAS RELIEVED AT THE HELM BY ELBERT JONES WHO TOOK OVER NED WENT ON DOWN
IT LOOKS TO ME AS IF IT COULD HAVE BEEN ONE OF SEVERAL PEOPLE AND I'LL BE SWITCHED IF I KNOW WHO I'LL KEEP MY EYES OPEN
THE MIRABELLE WAS NEARING TAHITI
WE'VE WATER AND FRESH STORES TO TAKE ON THERE
CHRIS LOST NO TIME AS SOON AS HE COULD DO IT WITHOUT BEING NOTICED IN HURRYING DOWN TO HIS CABIN
CERTAINLY MY BOY BOOMED OUT THE CAPTAIN HIS BLUE EYES ABRUPTLY KEEN AND PENETRATING
MISTER FINNEY WILL BE SOME TIME ON DECK WE CANNOT BE OVERHEARD IN HERE
HIS FACE FROZE WITH NERVOUSNESS THAT THIS MIGHT NOT DO AS AN ANSWER AND HE STOOD STIFF AND STILL BEFORE CAPTAIN BLIZZARD
THE CAPTAIN SAT FORWARD IN HIS CHAIR LOOKING AT HIM FOR A LONG MOMENT CONSIDERING
THEN HE SAID WELL I DO NOT CARE FOR IT I CANNOT SAY I DO
THIS SHIP IS MORE TO ME THAN WIFE OR MOTHER OR FAMILY
HE PAUSED FINGERING HIS LOWER LIP AND LOOKING SIDEWAYS IN A REFLECTIVE FASHION AT CHRIS STANDING BEFORE HIM
WE SHALL SAY NO MORE BUT I TRUST YOU UNDERSTAND THE RESPONSIBILITY YOU HAVE
THIS SHIP ITS CARGO AND ITS MEN WILL BE IN YOUR HANDS
YES SIR I THINK I CAN DO IT SAFELY OR I SHOULD NOT TRY SIR
CAPTAIN BLIZZARD'S ROUND PINK FACE CREASED IN HIS WINNING SMILE
HE THEN WENT ON TO DESCRIBE WHAT ELSE WAS TO FOLLOW THE COVERING OF THE SHIP WITH LEAVES TO MAKE IT BLEND WITH ITS SURROUNDINGS
CAMOUFLAGE WAS NOT A WORD THE CAPTAIN OR ANYONE ELSE OF HIS TIME YET UNDERSTOOD
WHAT CAN BE SAID DURING THAT TIME SIR CHRIS THOUGHT TO ASK
I AM SOMEWHAT SKILLED IN MEDICAMENTS I HAVE TO BE AS CAPTAIN OF A SHIP AND THE CREW KNOW IT
I SHALL SAY THAT YOU ARE IN MY OWN CABIN SO THAT I CAN CARE FOR YOU
NOT SINCE HE HAD LEFT MISTER WICKER HAD CHRIS FELT SUCH CONFIDENCE AS HE DID IN THE WORDS AND ACTIONS OF CAPTAIN BLIZZARD
HE KNEW NOW THAT HIS ABSENCE FOR AS LONG AS HE HAD TO BE AWAY WOULD BE COVERED UP AND SATISFACTORILY ACCOUNTED FOR
THEIR CONVERSATION HAD TAKEN SOME LITTLE WHILE
THE LEARNING OF MAGIC WAS BY NO MEANS EASY
HE HAD TOLD HIS MASTER AT ONCE ABOUT SIMON GOSLER HIS HORDE OF MONEY AND HIS HIDING PLACES FOR IT
CHRIS THEREFORE THREW HIMSELF INTO ALL THE PRELIMINARIES OF HIS TASK
ONE AFTERNOON WHEN HE RETURNED AFTER A REST TO MISTER WICKER'S STUDY HE SAW THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING NEW IN THE ROOM A BOWL WITH A GOLDFISH IN IT STOOD ON THE TABLE BUT MISTER WICKER WAS NOT TO BE SEEN
WHAT SHALL I DO FIRST
HOW YOU HAVE IMPROVED MY BOY HE EXCLAIMED IT IS NOW TIME FOR YOU TO TRY AND THIS IS AS GOOD A CHANGE AS ANY
SUPPOSE I CHANGE AND CAN'T CHANGE BACK
MISTER WICKER WAITED PATIENTLY BESIDE HIM FOR A FEW MOMENTS FOR CHRIS TO GET UP HIS COURAGE
THEN AS NOTHING HAPPENED WITH A VOICE LIKE A WHIP MISTER WICKER SAID START AT ONCE
THE SENSATION SPREAD FASTER AND FASTER
HIS HEAD SWAM AND HE FELT FAINT AND A LITTLE SICK BUT HE PERSISTED THROUGH THE FINAL WORDS
HE THOUGHT NOT WITHOUT A FEELING OF PRIDE AND COMMENCED EXPERIMENTING WITH HIS TAIL AND FINS WITH SUCH ENTHUSIASM AND DELIGHT THAT SOME LITTLE TIME ELAPSED BEFORE MISTER WICKER'S VOICE BOOMED CLOSE BY
SEVENTY FOUR BOOK ONE THE RETURN
THE FIGURE'S SHOES CARVED IN SOME EASTERN STYLE HAD CURVED UP POINTING TOES
THEN ALL AT ONCE THE IDEA CAME TO CHRIS
IF HE WAS TO BE A MAGICIAN COULD HE MAKE THIS BOY COME TO LIFE
HE SQUATTED ON HIS HAUNCHES EXAMINING THE CARVED WOODEN FIGURE ATTENTIVELY AND FELT CONVINCED THAT ONCE ALIVE THE BOY WOULD BE AN IDEAL AND HAPPY COMPANION
BUT HOW DID ONE CHANGE INANIMATE TO ANIMATE
CHRIS GOT UP AND STOLE BACK TO MISTER WICKER'S DOOR
HE HEARD THE MAGICIAN GOING UP THE SPIRAL STAIRCASE TO HIS ROOM ABOVE AND AFTER CHANGING HIMSELF TO A MOUSE TO SLIP UNDER THE DOOR AND SEE THAT THE ROOM WAS REALLY EMPTY CHRIS RESUMED HIS PROPER SHAPE AND OPENED THE DOORS OF THE CUPBOARD AT THE FAR END OF THE ROOM
THE AFTERNOON RAINY BEFORE INCREASED IN STORM
DUSK CAME TWO HOURS BEFORE ITS TIME THUNDER SNARLED IN THE SKY
CERTAIN ELEMENTS WERE TO BE MIXED AND POURED AT THE PROPER TIME
MISTER WICKER BEGAN MOVING ABOUT UPSTAIRS THE FLOORBOARDS CREAKED AND STILL CHRIS COULD NOT LEAVE UNTIL THE POTION FUMED AND GLOWED
WITH INFINITE CAUTION CHRIS CLOSED THE DOOR SILENTLY BEHIND HIM AND RUNNING LIGHTLY FORWARD REACHED THE FIGURE OF THE NEGRO BOY
IT WAS AS IF THE STIFFNESS MELTED
UNDER HIS EYES THE WOODEN FOLDS OF CLOTH BECAME RICH SILK EMBROIDERY GLEAMED IN ITS REALITY UPON THE COAT AND OH THE FACE
THE WOODEN GRIN LOOSENED THE LARGE EYES TURNED THE HAND HOLDING THE HARD BOUQUET OF CARVED FLOWERS MOVED AND LET THE BOUQUET FALL
SAY YOU KNOW SUMTHIN
CHRIS LOOKED FROM A NICKEL PLATED FLASHLIGHT TO A CAR JACK AND SPARK PLUG
KNOW WHO NEEDS A JOB BAD THAT'S JAKEY HARRIS
O K HE SAID
ONLY WHY DIDN'T YOU ASK HIM YOURSELF
MIKE BECAME UNEASY AND FISHED AN ELASTIC BAND OUT OF HIS POCKET MADE A FLICK OF PAPER AND SENT IT SOARING OUT INTO M STREET
WELL HE ADMITTED I DID
CHRIS ASKED AND FOR THE FIRST TIME THAT DAY THE HEAVY WEIGHT HE CARRIED WITHIN HIM LIFTED AND LIGHTENED A LITTLE
THINK HE REALLY NEEDS IT HE PURSUED
HE WOULD HAVE LIKED TO GET THE JOB FOR JAKEY WHO NEEDED IT BUT SOMEHOW THE TASK OF FACING MISTER WICKER ESPECIALLY NOW THAT THE LIGHT WAS GOING AND DUSK EDGING INTO THE STREETS WAS NOT WHAT CHRIS HAD INTENDED FOR ENDING THE AFTERNOON
MIKE'S EXPRESSION CHANGED AT ONCE TO ONE OF TRIUMPH BUT CHRIS WAS ONLY PARTLY ENCOURAGED
BETCHA AREN'T GOIN AFTER ALL CHRIS TURNED ON HIM
MIKE WAS STANDING ON THE CORNER
AW SHUCKS
CHRIS STARTED OFF ONCE MORE PASSING THE BLEAK LITTLE VICTORIAN CHURCH PERCHED ON THE HILL ABOVE MISTER WICKER'S HOUSE
AN EMPTY LOT CUT INTO BY CHURCH LANE GAVE A LOOK OF ISOLATION TO THE L SHAPED BRICK BUILDING THAT SERVED MISTER WICKER AS BOTH HOUSE AND PLACE OF BUSINESS
THE LONGER WING TOWARD THE BACK HAD A BACK DOOR THAT OPENED ONTO WATER STREET THE SPACE BETWEEN THE HOUSE AND WISCONSIN AVENUE HAD BEEN MADE INTO A NEAT OBLONG FLOWER GARDEN FENCED OFF FROM THE SIDEWALK BY BOX SHRUBS AND A WHITE PICKET FENCE
A LIVID YELLOW STAINED THE HORIZON BEYOND THE FACTORIES AND GRAY CLOUDS LOWERED AND TUMBLED ABOVE
THE AIR WAS GROWING CHILL AND CHRIS DECIDED TO FINISH HIS JOB
ALL AT ONCE HE WONDERED HOW HIS MOTHER WAS AND EVERYTHING IN HIM PINCHED AND TIGHTENED ITSELF
AT THE FOOT OF THE HILL HE REACHED THE HOUSE
THERE WERE THREE THINGS THAT ALWAYS CAUGHT HIS EYE AMID THE LITTER OF DUSTY PIECES
ON THE LEFT THE COIL OF ROPE IN THE CENTER THE MODEL OF A SAILING SHIP IN A GREEN GLASS BOTTLE AND ON THE RIGHT THE WOODEN STATUE OF A NEGRO BOY IN BAGGY TROUSERS TURKISH JACKET AND WHITE TURBAN
BUT THE NAME STILL SHOWED AT THE PROW AND MANY A TIME CHRIS SAFE AT HOME IN BED HAD SAILED IMAGINARY VOYAGES IN THE MIRABELLE
HE HAD NEVER SEEN ANYONE GO INTO MISTER WICKER'S SHOP NOW HE THOUGHT OF IT
HOW THEN DID HE LIVE AND WHAT DID HE EVER SELL
A SUDDEN CAR HORN WOKE HIM FROM HIS DREAM
OF THE MANY TIMES HE HAD EXAMINED MISTER WICKER'S WINDOW AND PORED OVER THE ROPE THE SHIP AND THE NUBIAN BOY HE HAD NEVER GONE INTO MISTER WICKER'S SHOP
SO NOW ALONE UNTIL SOMEONE SHOULD ANSWER THE BELL HE LOOKED EAGERLY IF UNEASILY AROUND HIM
WHAT WITH THE ONE WINDOW AND THE LOWERING DAY OUTSIDE THE LONG NARROW SHOP WAS SOMBER
HEAVY HAND HEWN BEAMS CROSSED IT FROM ONE SIDE TO THE OTHER
MISTER WICKER'S BACK BEING TOWARD THE SOURCE OF LIGHT CHRIS COULD NOT SEE HIS FACE
THE DOUBLE FANS OF MINUTE WRINKLES BREAKING FROM EYE CORNER TO TEMPLE AND JOINING WITH THOSE OVER THE CHEEKBONES WERE DRAWN INTO THE HORIZONTAL LINES ACROSS THE DOMED FOREHEAD
LITTLE TUFTS OF WHITE FUZZ ABOVE THE EARS WERE ALL THAT REMAINED OF THE ANTIQUARIAN'S HAIR BUT WHAT DREW AND HELD CHRIS'S GAZE WERE THE OLD MAN'S EYES
CHRIS BLINKED AND LOOKED AGAIN YES THEY WERE STILL THERE
CHRIS SWALLOWED AND HIS VOICE CAME BACK TO HIM
YES SIR HE SAID
I SAW YOUR SIGN AND I KNOW A BOY WHO NEEDS THE JOB
HE'S A SCHOOLMATE OF MINE
JAKEY HARRIS HIS NAME IS AND HE REALLY NEEDS THE JOB
I I JUST WONDERED IF THE PLACE WAS STILL OPEN
WHAT HE SAW WAS A FRESH CHEEKED LAD TALL FOR THIRTEEN STURDY WITH SINCERITY AND GOOD HUMOR IN HIS FACE AND SOMETHING SENSITIVE AND APPEALING ABOUT HIS EYES
HE GUESSED THERE MUST BE A LIVELY FIRE IN THAT ROOM BEYOND
WOULD THAT INTERFERE WITH JAKEY'S GETTING THE JOB SIR
BUT EVEN AS HE SLOWLY TURNED THE THOUGHT PIERCED HIS MIND WHY HAD HE NOT SEEN THE REFLECTION OF THE HEADLIGHTS OF THE CARS MOVING UP AROUND THE CORNER OF WATER STREET AND UP THE HILL TOWARD THE TRAFFIC SIGNALS
THE ROOM SEEMED OVERLY STILL
THEN IN THAT SECOND HE TURNED AND FACED ABOUT
THE WIDE BOW WINDOW WAS THERE BEFORE HIM THE THREE OBJECTS HE LIKED BEST SHOWING FROSTY IN THE MOONLIGHT THAT POURED IN FROM ACROSS THE WATER
ACROSS THE WATER WHERE WAS THE FREEWAY
IT WAS NO LONGER THERE NOR WERE THE HIGH WALLS AND SMOKESTACKS OF FACTORIES TO BE SEEN
THE WAREHOUSES WERE STILL THERE
FLABBERGASTED AND BREATHLESS CHRIS WAS UNAWARE THAT HE HAD MOVED CLOSER TO PEER OUT THE WINDOW IN EVERY DIRECTION
NO ELECTRIC SIGNS NO LAMPLIT STREETS
WHERE THE PEOPLE'S DRUGSTORE HAD STOOD BUT A HALF HOUR BEFORE ROSE THE ROOFS OF WHAT WAS EVIDENTLY AN INN
A COURTYARD WAS SPARSELY LIT BY A FLARING TORCH OR TWO SHOWING A SWINGING SIGN HUNG ON A POST
THE POST WAS PLANTED AT THE EDGE OF WHAT WAS NOW A BROAD AND MUDDY ROAD
A COACH WITH ITS TOP PILED HIGH WITH LUGGAGE STAMPED TO A HALT BESIDE THE FLAGGED COURTYARD
THEY MOVED INTO THE INN THE COACH RATTLED OFF TO THE STABLE
MY WINDOW HAS A POWER FOR THOSE FEW WHO ARE TO SEE
A THOUSAND BLESSINGS FROM A GRATEFUL HEART
PERUSAL SAID THE PAWNBROKER THAT'S THE WAY TO PERNOUNCE IT
HIS BOOKS TOLD HIM THAT TREASURE IS BEST HIDDEN UNDER LOOSE BOARDS UNLESS OF COURSE YOUR HOUSE HAS A SECRET PANEL WHICH HIS HAD NOT
HE GOT IT UP AND PUSHED HIS TREASURES AS FAR IN AS HE COULD ALONG THE ROUGH CRUMBLY SURFACE OF THE LATH AND PLASTER
WHEN DICKIE CAME DOWN HIS AUNT SLIGHTLY SLAPPED HIM AND HE TOOK THE HALFPENNY AND LIMPED OFF OBEDIENTLY
HE HAD NEVER SEEN ONE BEFORE AND IT INTERESTED HIM EXTREMELY
HE LOOKED ABOUT HIM AND KNEW THAT HE DID NOT AT ALL KNOW WHERE HE WAS
WHAT'S UP MATEY LOST YOUR WAY DICKIE EXPLAINED
WHEN HE SAID AVE I BIN ASLEEP
HERE WE ARE SAID THE MAN
NOT EXACKLY SAID THE MAN BUT IT'S ALL RIGHT
WHEN IT WAS OVER THE MAN ASKED DICKIE IF HE COULD WALK A LITTLE WAY AND WHEN DICKIE SAID HE COULD THEY SET OUT IN THE MOST FRIENDLY WAY SIDE BY SIDE
AND THE TEA AND ALL AN THE EGG
AND THIS IS THE PRETTIEST PLACE EVER I SEE
I SHALL CATCH IT A FAIR TREAT AS IT IS
SHE WAS WAITIN FOR THE WOOD TO BOIL THE KETTLE WHEN I COME OUT MOTHER
AIN'T BAD WHEN SHE'S IN A GOOD TEMPER
THAT AIN'T WHAT SHE'LL BE IN WHEN YOU GETS BACK
I GOT TO STICK IT SAID DICKIE SADLY I'D BEST BE GETTING HOME
I WOULDN'T GO OME NOT IF I WAS YOU SAID THE MAN
NO SAID DICKIE OH NO NO I NEVER
I AIN'T IT YER HAVE I LIKE WHAT YER AUNT DO
WELL THAT'LL SHOW YOU THE SORT OF MAN I AM
THE MAN'S MANNER WAS SO KIND AND HEARTY THE WHOLE ADVENTURE WAS SO WONDERFUL AND NEW IS IT COUNTRY WHERE YOU GOING
THE SUN SHOT LONG GOLDEN BEAMS THROUGH THE GAPS IN THE HEDGE
A BIRD PAUSED IN ITS FLIGHT ON A BRANCH QUITE CLOSE AND CLUNG THERE SWAYING
HE TOOK OUT OF HIS POCKET A NEW ENVELOPE A NEW SHEET OF PAPER AND A NEW PENCIL READY SHARPENED BY MACHINERY
AN I ASKS YOU LET ME COME ALONGER YOU GOT THAT
GET IT WROTE DOWN THEN DONE
THEN HE FOLDED IT AND PUT IT IN HIS POCKET
NOW WE'RE SQUARE HE SAID
THEY COULD PUT A MAN AWAY FOR LESS THAN THAT
I SEE THAT THERE IN A BOOK SAID DICKIE CHARMED
HE REWARD THE WAKE THE LAST OF THE ENGLISH AND I WUNNERED WHAT IT STOOD FOR
WILD ONES AIN'T ALF THE SIZE I LAY
ADVENTURES I SHOULD THINK SO
AH SAID DICKIE AND A FULL SILENCE FELL BETWEEN THEM
THAT WAS CHARMING BUT IT WAS PLEASANT TOO TO WASH THE MUD OFF ON THE WET GRASS
DICKIE ALWAYS REMEMBERED THAT MOMENT
SO YOU SHALL SAID MISTER BEALE A REG'LER WASH ALL OVER THIS VERY NIGHT I ALWAYS LIKE A WASH MESELF
SOME BLOKES THINK IT PAYS TO BE DIRTY BUT IT DON'T
IF YOU'RE CLEAN THEY SAY HONEST POVERTY AN IF YOU'RE DIRTY THEY SAY SERVE YOU RIGHT
YOU ARE GOOD SAID DICKIE I DO LIKE YOU
I KNOW YOU WILL SAID DICKIE WITH ENTHUSIASM I KNOW OW GOOD YOU ARE
BLESS ME SAID MISTER BEALE UNCOMFORTABLY WELL THERE
STEP OUT SONNY OR WE'LL NEVER GET THERE THIS SIDE CHRISTMAS
WELL YOU'LL KNOW ALL ABOUT IT PRESENTLY
IF CALLED TO A CASE SUPPOSED OR SUSPECTED TO BE ONE OF POISONING THE MEDICAL MAN HAS TWO DUTIES TO PERFORM TO SAVE THE PATIENT'S LIFE AND TO PLACE HIMSELF IN A POSITION TO GIVE EVIDENCE IF CALLED ON TO DO SO
HE SHOULD MAKE INQUIRIES AS TO SYMPTOMS AND TIME AT WHICH FOOD OR MEDICINE WAS LAST TAKEN
HE SHOULD NOTICE THE POSITION AND TEMPERATURE OF THE BODY THE CONDITION OF RIGOR MORTIS MARKS OF VIOLENCE APPEARANCE OF LIPS AND MOUTH
IN MAKING A POST MORTEM EXAMINATION THE ALIMENTARY CANAL SHOULD BE REMOVED AND PRESERVED FOR FURTHER INVESTIGATION
THE GUT AND THE GULLET BEING CUT ACROSS BETWEEN THESE LIGATURES THE STOMACH MAY BE REMOVED ENTIRE WITHOUT SPILLING ITS CONTENTS
IF THE MEDICAL PRACTITIONER IS IN DOUBT ON ANY POINT HE SHOULD OBTAIN TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FROM SOMEONE WHO HAS PAID ATTENTION TO THE SUBJECT
IN A CASE OF ATTEMPTED SUICIDE BY POISONING IS IT THE DUTY OF THE DOCTOR TO INFORM THE POLICE
THE BEST EMETIC IS THAT WHICH IS AT HAND
THE DOSE FOR AN ADULT IS TEN MINIMS
APOMORPHINE IS NOT ALLIED IN PHYSIOLOGICAL ACTION TO MORPHINE AND MAY BE GIVEN IN CASES OF NARCOTIC POISONING
TICKLING THE FAUCES WITH A FEATHER MAY EXCITE VOMITING
IN USING THE ELASTIC STOMACH TUBE SOME FLUID SHOULD BE INTRODUCED INTO THE STOMACH BEFORE ATTEMPTING TO EMPTY IT OR A PORTION OF THE MUCOUS MEMBRANE MAY BE SUCKED INTO THE APERTURE
THE TUBE SHOULD BE EXAMINED TO SEE THAT IT IS NOT BROKEN OR CRACKED AS ACCIDENTS HAVE HAPPENED FROM NEGLECTING THIS PRECAUTION
ANTIDOTES ARE USUALLY GIVEN HYPODERMICALLY OR IF BY MOUTH IN THE FORM OF TABLETS
IN THE ABSENCE OF A HYPODERMIC SYRINGE THE REMEDY MAY BE GIVEN BY THE RECTUM
NOTICE THE SMELL COLOUR AND GENERAL APPEARANCE OF THE MATTER SUBMITTED FOR EXAMINATION
FOR THE SEPARATION OF AN ALKALOID THE FOLLOWING IS THE PROCESS OF STAS OTTO
THIS PROCESS IS BASED UPON THE PRINCIPLE THAT THE SALTS OF THE ALKALOIDS ARE SOLUBLE IN ALCOHOL AND WATER AND INSOLUBLE IN ETHER
THE PURE ALKALOIDS WITH THE EXCEPTION OF MORPHINE IN ITS CRYSTALLINE FORM ARE SOLUBLE IN ETHER
TWO COOL THE MIXTURE AND FILTER WASH THE RESIDUE WITH STRONG ALCOHOL AND MIX THE FILTRATES
THE RESIDUE MAY BE SET ASIDE FOR THE DETECTION OF THE METALLIC POISONS IF SUSPECTED EXPEL THE ALCOHOL BY CAREFUL EVAPORATION
ON THE EVAPORATION OF THE ALCOHOL THE RESINOUS AND FATTY MATTERS SEPARATE
EVAPORATE THE FILTRATE TO A SYRUP AND EXTRACT WITH SUCCESSIVE PORTIONS OF ABSOLUTE ALCOHOL
SEPARATE THE ETHEREAL SOLUTION AND EVAPORATE
FIVE A PART OF THIS ETHEREAL SOLUTION IS POURED INTO A WATCH GLASS AND ALLOWED TO EVAPORATE
TO PURIFY IT ADD A SMALL QUANTITY OF DILUTE SULPHURIC ACID AND AFTER EVAPORATING TO THREE QUARTERS OF ITS BULK ADD A SATURATED SOLUTION OF CARBONATE OF POTASH OR SODA
BOIL THE FINELY DIVIDED SUBSTANCE WITH ABOUT ONE EIGHTH ITS BULK OF PURE HYDROCHLORIC ACID ADD FROM TIME TO TIME POTASSIC CHLORATE UNTIL THE SOLIDS ARE REDUCED TO A STRAW YELLOW FLUID
THE RESIDUE OF THE MATERIAL AFTER DIGESTION WITH HYDROCHLORIC ACID AND POTASSIUM CHLORATE MAY HAVE TO BE EXAMINED FOR SILVER LEAD AND BARIUM
THE SINGING AND LAUGHING WENT ON LONG AFTER HE HAD FALLEN ASLEEP AND IF LATER IN THE EVENING THERE WERE LOUD VOICED ARGUMENTS OR QUARRELS EVEN DICKIE DID NOT HEAR THEM
WHAT'S ALL THAT THERE DICKIE ASKED POINTING TO THE ODD KNOBBLY BUNDLES OF ALL SORTS AND SHAPES TIED ON TO THE PERAMBULATOR'S FRONT
TELL YER WHAT MATE LOOKS TO ME AS IF I'D TOOK A FANCY TO YOU
SWELP ME HE SAID HELPLESSLY
OH LOOK SAID DICKIE THE FLOWERS
THEY'RE ONLY WEEDS SAID BEALE
BUT I SHALL HAVE THEM WHILE THEY'RE ALIVE SAID DICKIE AS HE HAD SAID TO THE PAWNBROKER ABOUT THE MOONFLOWERS
HI THERE GOES A RABBIT
SEE IM CROST THE ROAD THERE SEE HIM
HOW BEAUTIFUL SAID DICKIE WRIGGLING WITH DELIGHT
THIS LIFE OF THE RABBIT AS DESCRIBED BY MISTER BEALE WAS THE CHILD'S FIRST GLIMPSE OF FREEDOM I'D LIKE TO BE A RABBIT
OW'M I TO WHEEL THE BLOOMIN PRAM IF YOU GOES ON LIKE AS IF YOU WAS A BAG OF EELS
I LIKE YOU NEXTER MY OWN DADDY AND MISTER BAXTER NEXT DOOR
THAT'S ALL RIGHT SAID MISTER BEALE AWKWARDLY
DICKIE QUICK TO IMITATE TOUCHED HIS
POOR LITTLE MAN SAID THE LADY YOU MISS YOUR MOTHER DON'T YOU
OH WELL DONE LITTLE UN SAID MISTER BEALE TO HIMSELF
THE TWO TRAVELLERS WERE LEFT FACING EACH OTHER THE RICHER BY A PENNY AND OH WONDERFUL GOOD FORTUNE A WHOLE HALF CROWN
NO I NEVER SAID DICKIE ERE'S THE STEEVER
YOU STICK TO THAT SAID BEALE RADIANT WITH DELIGHT YOU'RE A FAIR MASTERPIECE YOU ARE YOU EARNED IT HONEST IF EVER A KID DONE
THEY WENT ON UP THE HILL AS HAPPY AS ANY ONE NEED WISH TO BE
PLEASE DO NOT BE TOO SHOCKED
REMEMBER THAT NEITHER OF THEM KNEW ANY BETTER
TO THE ELDER TRAMP LIES AND BEGGING WERE NATURAL MEANS OF LIVELIHOOD
BUT YOU SAID THE BED WITH THE GREEN CURTAINS URGED DICKIE
WHICH THIS AIN'T NOT BY NO MEANS
THE NIGHT IS FULL OF INTERESTING LITTLE SOUNDS THAT WILL NOT AT FIRST LET YOU SLEEP THE RUSTLE OF LITTLE WILD THINGS IN THE HEDGES THE BARKING OF DOGS IN DISTANT FARMS THE CHIRP OF CRICKETS AND THE CROAKING OF FROGS
THE NEW GAME OF BEGGING AND INVENTING STORIES TO INTEREST THE PEOPLE FROM WHOM IT WAS WORTH WHILE TO BEG WENT ON GAILY DAY BY DAY AND WEEK BY WEEK AND DICKIE BY CONSTANT PRACTICE GREW SO CLEVER AT TAKING HIS PART IN THE ACTING THAT MISTER BEALE WAS QUITE DAZED WITH ADMIRATION
BLESSED IF I EVER SEE SUCH A NIPPER HE SAID OVER AND OVER AGAIN
CLEVER AS A TRAINDAWG E IS AN ALL OUTER IS OWN EAD
I AIN'T SURE AS I ADN'T BETTER STICK TO THE ROAD AND KEEP AWAY FROM OLD ANDS LIKE YOU JIM
I OPE E'S CLEVER ENOUGH TO DO WOT E'S TOLD KEEP IS MUG SHUT THAT'S ALL
IF E'S STRAIGHT E'LL DO FOR ME AND IF HE AIN'T I'LL DO FOR IM SEE
SEE THAT BLOKE JUST NOW SAID MISTER BEALE YUSS SAID DICKIE
WELL YOU NEVER SEE IM
IF ANY ONE ARSTS YOU IF YOU EVER SEE IM YOU NEVER SET EYES ON IM IN ALL YOUR BORN NOT TO REMEMBER IM
DICKIE WAS FULL OF QUESTIONS BUT MISTER BEALE HAD NO ANSWERS FOR THEM
NOR WAS IT SUNDAY ON WHICH THEY TOOK A REST AND WASHED THEIR SHIRTS ACCORDING TO MISTER BEALE'S RULE OF LIFE
THEY DID NOT STAY THERE BUT WALKED OUT ACROSS THE DOWNS WHERE THE SKYLARKS WERE SINGING AND ON A DIP OF THE DOWNS CAME UPON GREAT STONE WALLS AND TOWERS VERY STRONG AND GRAY
WHAT'S THAT THERE SAID DICKIE
WITH THAT NOTORIOUS FAILING OF HIS HE WAS NOT THE SORT OF PERSON ONE WANTED IN ONE'S HOUSE
WELL THE FAILING STILL EXISTS DOESN'T IT SAID HER HUSBAND OR DO YOU SUPPOSE A REFORM OF CHARACTER IS ENTAILED ALONG WITH THE ESTATE
BESIDES CYNICISM APART HIS BEING RICH WILL MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN THE WAY PEOPLE WILL LOOK AT HIS FAILING
WHEN A MAN IS ABSOLUTELY WEALTHY NOT MERELY WELL TO DO ALL SUSPICION OF SORDID MOTIVE NATURALLY DISAPPEARS THE THING BECOMES MERELY A TIRESOME MALADY
WILFRID PIGEONCOTE HAD SUDDENLY BECOME HEIR TO HIS UNCLE SIR WILFRID PIGEONCOTE ON THE DEATH OF HIS COUSIN MAJOR WILFRID PIGEONCOTE WHO HAD SUCCUMBED TO THE AFTER EFFECTS OF A POLO ACCIDENT
A WILFRID PIGEONCOTE HAD COVERED HIMSELF WITH HONOURS IN THE COURSE OF MARLBOROUGH'S CAMPAIGNS AND THE NAME WILFRID HAD BEEN A BAPTISMAL WEAKNESS IN THE FAMILY EVER SINCE THE NEW HEIR TO THE FAMILY DIGNITY AND ESTATES WAS A YOUNG MAN OF ABOUT FIVE AND TWENTY WHO WAS KNOWN MORE BY REPUTATION THAN BY PERSON TO A WIDE CIRCLE OF COUSINS AND KINSFOLK
AND THE REPUTATION WAS AN UNPLEASANT ONE
FROM HIS LATE SCHOOLDAYS ONWARD HE HAD BEEN POSSESSED BY AN ACUTE AND OBSTINATE FORM OF KLEPTOMANIA HE HAD THE ACQUISITIVE INSTINCT OF THE COLLECTOR WITHOUT ANY OF THE COLLECTOR'S DISCRIMINATION
THE SEARCH USUALLY PRODUCED A LARGE AND VARIED YIELD THIS IS FUNNY SAID PETER PIGEONCOTE TO HIS WIFE SOME HALF HOUR AFTER THEIR CONVERSATION HERE'S A TELEGRAM FROM WILFRID SAYING HE'S PASSING THROUGH HERE IN HIS MOTOR AND WOULD LIKE TO STOP AND PAY US HIS RESPECTS
SIGNED WILFRID PIGEONCOTE
I SUPPOSE HE'S BRINGING US A PRESENT FOR THE SILVER WEDDING GOOD GRACIOUS
THE TALK FLITTED NERVOUSLY AND HURRIEDLY FROM ONE IMPERSONAL TOPIC TO ANOTHER
IN THE DRAWING ROOM AFTER DINNER THEIR NERVOUSNESS AND AWKWARDNESS INCREASED
OH WE HAVEN'T SHOWN YOU THE SILVER WEDDING PRESENTS SAID MISSUS PETER SUDDENLY AS THOUGH STRUCK BY A BRILLIANT IDEA FOR ENTERTAINING THE GUEST HERE THEY ALL ARE
SUCH NICE USEFUL GIFTS A FEW DUPLICATES OF COURSE
SEVEN CREAM JUGS PUT IN PETER
WE FEEL THAT WE MUST LIVE ON CREAM FOR THE REST OF OUR LIVES
OF COURSE SOME OF THEM CAN BE CHANGED
I PUT IT DOWN BY THE CLARET JUG SAID WILFRID BUSY WITH ANOTHER OBJECT
VIGILANCE WAS NOT COMPLETELY CROWNED WITH A SENSE OF VICTORY
AFTER THEY HAD SAID GOOD NIGHT TO THEIR VISITOR MISSUS PETER EXPRESSED HER CONVICTION THAT HE HAD TAKEN SOMETHING
HOW ON EARTH ARE WE TO KNOW SAID PETER THE MEAN PIG HASN'T BROUGHT US A PRESENT AND I'M HANGED IF HE SHALL CARRY ONE OFF
IT'S THE ONLY THING TO DO
WILFRID WAS LATE IN COMING DOWN TO BREAKFAST AND HIS MANNER SHOWED PLAINLY THAT SOMETHING WAS AMISS
IT'S AN UNPLEASANT THING TO HAVE TO SAY HE BLURTED OUT PRESENTLY BUT I'M AFRAID YOU MUST HAVE A THIEF AMONG YOUR SERVANTS SOMETHING'S BEEN TAKEN OUT OF MY PORTMANTEAU
IT WAS A LITTLE PRESENT FROM MY MOTHER AND MYSELF FOR YOUR SILVER WEDDING
I SHOULD HAVE GIVEN IT TO YOU LAST NIGHT AFTER DINNER ONLY IT HAPPENED TO BE A CREAM JUG AND YOU SEEMED ANNOYED AT HAVING SO MANY DUPLICATES SO I FELT RATHER AWKWARD ABOUT GIVING YOU ANOTHER
THE SNATCHER HAD BEEN AN ORPHAN THESE MANY YEARS
LADY ERNESTINE PIGEONCOTE HIS MOTHER MOVED IN CIRCLES WHICH WERE ENTIRELY BEYOND THEIR COMPASS OR AMBITIONS AND THE SON WOULD PROBABLY ONE DAY BE AN AMBASSADOR
HUSBAND AND WIFE LOOKED BLANKLY AND DESPERATELY AT ONE ANOTHER
IT WAS MISSUS PETER WHO ARRIVED FIRST AT AN INSPIRATION HOW DREADFUL TO THINK THERE ARE THIEVES IN THE HOUSE WE KEEP THE DRAWING ROOM LOCKED UP AT NIGHT OF COURSE BUT ANYTHING MIGHT BE CARRIED OFF WHILE WE ARE AT BREAKFAST
SHE ROSE AND WENT OUT HURRIEDLY AS THOUGH TO ASSURE HERSELF THAT THE DRAWING ROOM WAS NOT BEING STRIPPED OF ITS SILVERWARE AND RETURNED A MOMENT LATER BEARING A CREAM JUG IN HER HANDS
THE PIGEONCOTES HAD TURNED PALER THAN EVER MISSUS PETER HAD A FINAL INSPIRATION
PETER DASHED OUT OF THE ROOM WITH GLAD RELIEF HE HAD LIVED SO LONG DURING THE LAST FEW MINUTES THAT A GOLDEN WEDDING SEEMED WITHIN MEASURABLE DISTANCE
MISSUS PETER TURNED TO HER GUEST WITH CONFIDENTIAL COYNESS
PETER'S LITTLE WEAKNESS IT RUNS IN THE FAMILY GOOD LORD
DO YOU MEAN TO SAY HE'S A KLEPTOMANIAC LIKE COUSIN SNATCHER
BRAVE LITTLE WOMAN SAID PETER WITH A GASP OF RELIEF I COULD NEVER HAVE DONE IT
UNFORTUNATELY THERE COULD BE NO DOUBT OR MISCONCEPTION AS TO PLATTERBAFF'S GUILT
HE HAD NOT ONLY PLEADED GUILTY BUT HAD EXPRESSED HIS INTENTION OF REPEATING HIS ESCAPADE IN OTHER DIRECTIONS AS SOON AS CIRCUMSTANCES PERMITTED THROUGHOUT THE TRIAL HE WAS BUSY EXAMINING A SMALL MODEL OF THE FREE TRADE HALL IN MANCHESTER
THE JURY COULD NOT POSSIBLY FIND THAT THE PRISONER HAD NOT DELIBERATELY AND INTENTIONALLY BLOWN UP THE ALBERT HALL THE QUESTION WAS COULD THEY FIND ANY EXTENUATING CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH WOULD PERMIT OF AN ACQUITTAL
OF COURSE ANY SENTENCE WHICH THE LAW MIGHT FEEL COMPELLED TO INFLICT WOULD BE FOLLOWED BY AN IMMEDIATE PARDON BUT IT WAS HIGHLY DESIRABLE FROM THE GOVERNMENT'S POINT OF VIEW THAT THE NECESSITY FOR SUCH AN EXERCISE OF CLEMENCY SHOULD NOT ARISE
A HEADLONG PARDON ON THE EVE OF A BYE ELECTION WITH THREATS OF A HEAVY VOTING DEFECTION IF IT WERE WITHHELD OR EVEN DELAYED WOULD NOT NECESSARILY BE A SURRENDER BUT IT WOULD LOOK LIKE ONE
HENCE THE ANXIETY IN THE CROWDED COURT AND IN THE LITTLE GROUPS GATHERED ROUND THE TAPE MACHINES IN WHITEHALL AND DOWNING STREET AND OTHER AFFECTED CENTRES
THE JURY RETURNED FROM CONSIDERING THEIR VERDICT THERE WAS A FLUTTER AN EXCITED MURMUR A DEATHLIKE HUSH
THE FOREMAN DELIVERED HIS MESSAGE
THE JURY FIND THE PRISONER GUILTY OF BLOWING UP THE ALBERT HALL
THE JURY WISH TO ADD A RIDER DRAWING ATTENTION TO THE FACT THAT A BY ELECTION IS PENDING IN THE PARLIAMENTARY DIVISION OF NEMESIS ON HAND
AND MAY THE LORD HAVE MERCY ON THE POLL A JUNIOR COUNSEL EXCLAIMED IRREVERENTLY
FIFTEEN HUNDRED SAID THE PRIME MINISTER WITH A SHUDDER IT'S TOO HORRIBLE TO THINK OF
OUR MAJORITY LAST TIME WAS ONLY A THOUSAND AND SEVEN
SEVEN THIRTY AMENDED THE PRIME MINISTER WE MUST AVOID ANY APPEARANCE OF PRECIPITANCY
NOT LATER THAN SEVEN THIRTY THEN SAID THE CHIEF ORGANISER I HAVE PROMISED THE AGENT DOWN THERE THAT HE SHALL BE ABLE TO DISPLAY POSTERS ANNOUNCING PLATTERBAFF IS OUT BEFORE THE POLL OPENS
HE SAID IT WAS OUR ONLY CHANCE OF GETTING A TELEGRAM RADPROP IS IN TO NIGHT
DESPITE THE EARLINESS OF THE HOUR A SMALL CROWD HAD GATHERED IN THE STREET OUTSIDE AND THE HORRIBLE MENACING TRELAWNEY REFRAIN OF THE FIFTEEN HUNDRED VOTING MEN CAME IN A STEADY MONOTONOUS CHANT
HE EXCLAIMED WON'T GO
HE SAYS HE NEVER HAS LEFT PRISON WITHOUT A BRASS BAND TO PLAY HIM OUT AND HE'S NOT GOING TO GO WITHOUT ONE NOW
SAID THE PRIME MINISTER WE CAN HARDLY BE SUPPOSED TO SUPPLY A RELEASED PRISONER WITH A BRASS BAND HOW ON EARTH COULD WE DEFEND IT ON THE ESTIMATES
ANYWAY HE WON'T GO UNLESS HE HAS A BAND
POLL OPENS IN FIVE MINUTES
IS PLATTERBAFF OUT YET
IN HEAVEN'S NAME WHY
THE CHIEF ORGANISER RANG OFF
THIS IS NOT A MOMENT FOR STANDING ON DIGNITY HE OBSERVED BLUNTLY MUSICIANS MUST BE SUPPLIED AT ONCE
CAN'T YOU GET A STRIKE PERMIT ASKED THE ORGANISER
I'LL TRY SAID THE HOME SECRETARY AND WENT TO THE TELEPHONE
EIGHT O'CLOCK STRUCK THE CROWD OUTSIDE CHANTED WITH AN INCREASING VOLUME OF SOUND WILL VOTE THE OTHER WAY
A TELEGRAM WAS BROUGHT IN
IT WAS FROM THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE ROOMS AT NEMESIS
WITHOUT A BAND HE WOULD NOT GO AND THEY HAD NO BAND
A QUARTER PAST TEN HALF PAST
HAVE YOU ANY BAND INSTRUMENTS OF AN EASY NATURE TO PLAY
DEMANDED THE CHIEF ORGANISER OF THE PRISON GOVERNOR DRUMS CYMBALS THOSE SORT OF THINGS
THE WARDERS HAVE A PRIVATE BAND OF THEIR OWN SAID THE GOVERNOR BUT OF COURSE I COULDN'T ALLOW THE MEN THEMSELVES
LEND US THE INSTRUMENTS SAID THE CHIEF ORGANISER
THE POPULAR SONG OF THE MOMENT REPLIED THE AGITATOR AFTER A MOMENT'S REFLECTION
IT WAS A TUNE THEY HAD ALL HEARD HUNDREDS OF TIMES SO THERE WAS NO DIFFICULTY IN TURNING OUT A PASSABLE IMITATION OF IT TO THE IMPROVISED STRAINS OF I DIDN'T WANT TO DO IT THE PRISONER STRODE FORTH TO FREEDOM
THE WORD OF THE SONG HAD REFERENCE IT WAS UNDERSTOOD TO THE INCARCERATING GOVERNMENT AND NOT TO THE DESTROYER OF THE ALBERT HALL
THE SEAT WAS LOST AFTER ALL BY A NARROW MAJORITY
THE LOCAL TRADE UNIONISTS TOOK OFFENCE AT THE FACT OF CABINET MINISTERS HAVING PERSONALLY ACTED AS STRIKE BREAKERS AND EVEN THE RELEASE OF PLATTERBAFF FAILED TO PACIFY THEM
EVIDENTLY THE INTENTION WAS TO MAKE THINGS PLEASANT FOR THE ROYAL FOE OF TOBACCO DURING HIS VISIT
THE PROHIBITION IN THE REGULATION QUOTED OF SMOKING IN SAINT MARY'S CHURCH REFERRED IT MAY BE NOTED TO THE ACT WHICH WAS HELD THEREIN
SOMETIMES TOBACCO WAS USED IN CHURCH FOR DISINFECTING OR DEODORIZING PURPOSES
BLACKBURN ARCHBISHOP OF YORK WAS A GREAT SMOKER
ON ONE OCCASION HE WAS AT SAINT MARY'S CHURCH NOTTINGHAM FOR A CONFIRMATION
ANOTHER EIGHTEENTH CENTURY CLERICAL WORTHY THE FAMOUS DOCTOR PARR AN INVETERATE SMOKER WAS ACCUSTOMED TO DO WHAT MISTER DISNEY PREVENTED ARCHBISHOP BLACKBURN FROM DOING HE SMOKED IN HIS VESTRY AT HATTON
PARR WAS SUCH A CONTINUAL SMOKER THAT ANYONE WHO CAME INTO HIS COMPANY IF HE HAD NEVER SMOKED BEFORE HAD TO LEARN THE USE OF A PIPE AS A MEANS OF SELF DEFENCE
ONE SUNDAY SAYS MISTER DITCHFIELD HE HAD AN EXTRA PIPE AND JOSHUA THE CLERK TOLD HIM THAT THE PEOPLE WERE GETTING IMPATIENT
LET THEM SING ANOTHER PSALM SAID THE CURATE
THEY HAVE SIR REPLIED THE CLERK
THEN LET THEM SING THE HUNDRED AND NINETEENTH REPLIED THE CURATE
SIX ARMS THE NEAREST WITHIN REACH PRESENTED WITH AN OBEDIENT START AS MANY TOBACCO POUCHES TO THE MAN OF OFFICE
DAVID DEANS HOWEVER DID NOT AT ALL APPROVE THIS IRREVERENCE
GOING TO CHURCH AT HAYES IN THOSE DAYS MUST HAVE BEEN QUITE AN EXCITING EXPERIENCE
WHEN THESE MEN IN THE COURSE OF MY REMONSTRANCE FOUND THAT I WAS NOT GOING TO CONTINUE THE CUSTOM THEY NO LONGER CARED TO BE COMMUNICANTS
THEN MOSES WAS AFRAID AND SAID SURELY THE THING IS KNOWN
HOLD ON HOLD FAST HOLD OUT PATIENCE IS GENIUS
LET US HAVE FAITH THAT RIGHT MAKES MIGHT AND IN THAT FAITH LET US DARE TO DO OUR DUTY AS WE UNDERSTAND IT LINCOLN
THE EGYPTIAN BACKGROUND OF THE BONDAGE
EVERY ONE WHO IS TURBULENT HAS BEEN FOUND BY KING MERNEPTAH THE TESTIMONY OF THE OLDEST BIBLICAL NARRATIVES REGARDING THE SOJOURN OF THE HEBREWS IN EGYPT IS ALSO IN PERFECT ACCORD WITH THE PICTURE WHICH THE CONTEMPORARY EGYPTIAN INSCRIPTIONS GIVE OF THE PERIOD
THE ABSENCE OF DETAILED REFERENCE TO THE HEBREWS IS THEREFORE PERFECTLY NATURAL
IT SEEMS PROBABLE THAT NOT ALL BUT ONLY PART OF THE TRIBES WHICH ULTIMATELY COALESCED INTO THE HEBREW NATION FOUND THEIR WAY TO EGYPT
THE STORIES REGARDING JOSEPH THE TRADITIONAL FATHER OF EPHRAIM AND MANASSEH IMPLY THAT THESE STRONG CENTRAL TRIBES POSSIBLY TOGETHER WITH THE SOUTHERN TRIBES OF BENJAMIN AND JUDAH WERE THE CHIEF ACTORS IN THIS OPENING SCENE IN ISRAEL'S HISTORY
THE BIBLICAL NARRATIVES APPARENTLY DISAGREE REGARDING THE DURATION OF THE SOJOURN IN EGYPT
THE LATER TRADITIONS TEND TO EXTEND THE PERIOD
HERE WERE FOUND SEVERAL INSCRIPTIONS BEARING THE EGYPTIAN NAME OF THE CITY P ATUM HOUSE OF THE GOD ATUM
A CONTEMPORARY INSCRIPTION ALSO STATES THAT HE FOUNDED NEAR PITHUM THE HOUSE OF RAMSES A CITY WITH A ROYAL RESIDENCE AND TEMPLES
THAT THE HEBREWS WERE RESTIVE UNDER THIS TYRANNY WAS NATURAL INEVITABLE
WAS ANY OTHER PROCEDURE TO BE EXPECTED FROM A DESPOTIC RULER OF THAT LAND AND DAY
THE MAKING OF A LOYAL PATRIOT
THE STORY OF MOSES BIRTH AND EARLY CHILDHOOD IS ONE OF THE MOST INTERESTING CHAPTERS IN BIBLICAL HISTORY
WAS MOSES JUSTIFIED IN RESISTING THE EGYPTIAN TASKMASTER
IS PEONAGE ALWAYS DISASTROUS NOT ONLY TO ITS VICTIMS BUT ALSO TO THE GOVERNMENT IMPOSING IT
NATURALLY HE WENT TO THE LAND OF MIDIAN
THE WILDERNESS TO THE EAST OF EGYPT HAD FOR CENTURIES BEEN THE PLACE OF REFUGE FOR EGYPTIAN FUGITIVES
FROM ABOUT TWO THOUSAND B C
ON THE BORDERS OF THE WILDERNESS HE FOUND CERTAIN BEDOUIN HERDSMEN WHO RECEIVED HIM HOSPITABLY
THESE SAND WANDERERS SENT HIM ON FROM TRIBE TO TRIBE UNTIL HE REACHED THE LAND OF KEDEM EAST OF THE DEAD SEA WHERE HE REMAINED FOR A YEAR AND A HALF
LATER HE FOUND HIS WAY TO THE COURT OF ONE OF THE LOCAL KINGS IN CENTRAL PALESTINE WHERE HE MARRIED AND BECAME IN TIME A PROSPEROUS LOCAL PRINCE
THE SCHOOL OF THE WILDERNESS
THE STORY OF MOSES IS IN MANY WAYS CLOSELY PARALLEL TO THAT OF SINUHIT
THE PRIEST OF THE SUB TRIBE OF THE KENITES RECEIVED HIM INTO HIS HOME AND GAVE HIM HIS DAUGHTER IN MARRIAGE
NOTE THE CHARACTERISTIC ORIENTAL IDEA OF MARRIAGE
HERE MOSES LEARNED THE LESSONS THAT WERE ESSENTIAL FOR HIS TRAINING AS THE LEADER AND DELIVERER OF HIS PEOPLE
AFTER THE CAPTURE OF JERICHO CERTAIN OF THEM WENT UP WITH THE SOUTHERN TRIBES TO CONQUER SOUTHERN PALESTINE
MANY MODERN SCHOLARS DRAW THE CONCLUSION FROM THE BIBLICAL NARRATIVE THAT IT WAS FROM THE KENITES THAT MOSES FIRST LEARNED OF YAHWEH OR AS THE DISTINCTIVE NAME OF ISRAEL'S GOD WAS TRANSLATED BY LATER JEWISH SCRIBES JEHOVAH
DO THE EARLIEST HEBREW TRADITIONS IMPLY THAT THE ANCESTORS OF THE ISRAELITES WERE WORSHIPPERS OF JEHOVAH
THE TITLE OF HIS FATHER IN LAW IMPLIES THAT THIS PRIEST MINISTERED AT SOME WILDERNESS SANCTUARY
MOSES IN THE HOME OF THE MIDIAN PRIEST WAS BROUGHT INTO DIRECT AND CONSTANT CONTACT WITH THE JEHOVAH WORSHIP
THE CRUEL FATE OF HIS PEOPLE AND THE PAINFUL EXPERIENCE IN EGYPT THAT HAD DRIVEN HIM INTO THE WILDERNESS PREPARED HIS MIND TO RECEIVE THIS TRAINING
HIS QUEST WAS FOR A JUST AND STRONG GOD ABLE TO DELIVER THE OPPRESSED
THE WILDERNESS WITH ITS LURKING FOES AND THE EVER PRESENT DREAD OF HUNGER AND THIRST DEEPENED HIS SENSE OF NEED AND OF DEPENDENCE UPON A POWER ABLE TO GUIDE THE DESTINIES OF MEN
THE PEASANTS OF THE VAST ANTOLIAN PLAIN IN CENTRAL ASIA MINOR STILL CALL EVERY LIFE GIVING SPRING GOD HATH GIVEN
THE CONSTANT NECESSITY OF MEETING THE DANGERS OF THE WILDERNESS AND OF DEFENDING THE FLOCKS ENTRUSTED TO MOSES CARE DEVELOPED HIS COURAGE AND POWER OF LEADERSHIP AND ACTION
PROAS IN THAT QUARTER WERE USUALLY DISTRUSTED BY SHIPS IT IS TRUE BUT THE SEA IS FULL OF THEM AND FAR MORE ARE INNOCENT THAN ARE GUILTY OF ANY ACTS OF VIOLENCE
AN HOUR AFTER THE SUN HAD SET THE WIND FELL TO A LIGHT AIR THAT JUST KEPT STEERAGE WAY ON THE SHIP
FORTUNATELY THE JOHN WAS NOT ONLY FAST BUT SHE MINDED HER HELM AS A LIGHT FOOTED GIRL TURNS IN A LIVELY DANCE
I NEVER WAS IN A BETTER STEERING SHIP MOST ESPECIALLY IN MODERATE WEATHER
MISTER MARBLE HE I DO BELIEVE WAS FAIRLY SNOOZING ON THE HEN COOPS BEING LIKE THE SAILS AS ONE MIGHT SAY BARELY ASLEEP
AT THAT MOMENT I HEARD A NOISE ONE FAMILIAR TO SEAMEN THAT OF AN OAR FALLING IN A BOAT
I SANG OUT SAIL HO AND CLOSE ABOARD
HE WAS TOO MUCH OF A SEAMAN TO REQUIRE A SECOND LOOK IN ORDER TO ASCERTAIN WHAT WAS TO BE DONE
ALTHOUGH THEY WENT THREE FEET TO OUR TWO THIS GAVE US A MOMENT OF BREATHING TIME
AS OUR SHEETS WERE ALL FLYING FORWARD AND REMAINED SO FOR A FEW MINUTES IT GAVE ME LEISURE TO LOOK ABOUT
I SOON SAW BOTH PROAS AND GLAD ENOUGH WAS I TO PERCEIVE THAT THEY HAD NOT APPROACHED MATERIALLY NEARER
MISTER KITE OBSERVED THIS ALSO AND REMARKED THAT OUR MOVEMENTS HAD BEEN SO PROMPT AS TO TAKE THE RASCALS ABACK
A BREATHLESS STILLNESS SUCCEEDED
THE PROAS DID NOT ALTER THEIR COURSE BUT NEARED US FAST
I HEARD THE RATTLING OF THE BOARDING PIKES TOO AS THEY WERE CUT ADRIFT FROM THE SPANKER BOOM AND FELL UPON THE DECKS
KITE WENT AFT AND RETURNED WITH THREE OR FOUR MUSKETS AND AS MANY PIKES
THE STILLNESS THAT REIGNED ON BOTH SIDES WAS LIKE THAT OF DEATH
THE JOHN BEHAVED BEAUTIFULLY AND CAME ROUND LIKE A TOP
THE QUESTION WAS NOW WHETHER WE COULD PASS THEM OR NOT BEFORE THEY GOT NEAR ENOUGH TO GRAPPLE
THE CAPTAIN BEHAVED PERFECTLY WELL IN THIS CRITICAL INSTANT COMMANDING A DEAD SILENCE AND THE CLOSEST ATTENTION TO HIS ORDERS
NOT A SOUL ON BOARD THE JOHN WAS HURT
ON OUR SIDE WE GAVE THE GENTLEMEN THE FOUR SIXES TWO AT THE NEAREST AND TWO AT THE STERN MOST PROA WHICH WAS STILL NEAR A CABLE'S LENGTH DISTANT
THEY WERE LIKE THE YELLS OF FIENDS IN ANGUISH
I DOUBT IF WE TOUCHED A MAN IN THE NEAREST PROA
IN THIS STATE THE SHIP PASSED AHEAD ALL HER CANVAS BEING FULL LEAVING THE PROA MOTIONLESS IN HER WAKE
BUT SCUSE ME DIDN'T YO FIGGER ON DOIN SOME DETECTIN AN GIVE UP FISHIN
AND SHAG WITH THE FREEDOM OF AN OLD SERVANT STOOD LOOKING AT HIS MASTER AS IF NOT QUITE UNDERSTANDING THE NEW TWIST THE AFFAIRS HAD TAKEN
I'M GOING OFF FISHING I MAY NOT CATCH ANYTHING I MAY NOT WANT TO AFTER I GET THERE
GET READY SHAG YES SAH COLONEL
AND HAVING PUT HIMSELF IN A FAIR WAY AS HE HOPED TO SOLVE SOME OF THE PROBLEMS CONNECTED WITH THE DARCY CASE COLONEL ASHLEY WENT DOWN TO POLICE HEADQUARTERS TO LEARN MORE FACTS IN CONNECTION WITH THE MURDER OF THE EAST INDIAN
PINKUS AND DONOVAN HAVEN'T THEY CARROLL YEP
CARROLL WAS TOO MUCH ENGAGED IN WATCHING THE BLUE SMOKE CURL LAZILY UPWARD FROM HIS CIGAR JUST THEN TO SAY MORE
ARE YOU GOING TO WORK ON THAT CASE COLONEL
BUT HE HADN'T ANY MORE TO DO WITH IT COLONEL THAN THAT CAT
PERHAPS NOT ADMITTED COLONEL ASHLEY
WE'VE GOT OUR MAN AND THAT'S ALL WE WANT
YOU'RE ON THE DARCY CASE THEY TELL ME IN A WAY YES
I'M WORKING IN THE INTERESTS OF THE YOUNG MAN
IT'S JUST ONE OF THEM COINCIDENCES LIKE
BUSTED HIS HEAD IN WITH A HEAVY CANDLESTICK ONE OF A PAIR
GAD EXCLAIMED THE COLONEL
THE VERY PAIR I WAS GOING TO BUY
LOOK HERE COLONEL DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THIS
AND THE DETECTIVE'S PROFESSIONAL INSTINCTS GOT THE UPPER HAND OF HIS FRIENDLINESS NOT THE LEAST IN THE WORLD NOT AS MUCH AS YOU DO WAS THE COOL ANSWER
I HAPPENED TO SEE THOSE CANDLESTICKS IN THE WINDOW OF SINGA PHUT'S SHOP THE OTHER DAY AND I MADE UP MY MIND TO BUY THEM WHEN I HAD A CHANCE
NOW I'M AFRAID I WON'T BUT HOW DID IT HAPPEN
PHUT I DON'T KNOW WHETHER THAT'S HIS FIRST OR HIS LAST NAME ANYHOW HE HAD A PARTNER NAMED SHERE ALI
ANYHOW HE AND PHUT DIDN'T GET ALONG VERY WELL IT SEEMS
NEIGHBORS OFTEN HEARD EM SCRAPPIN A LOT AND THIS AFTERNOON THEY WENT AT IT AGAIN HOT AND HEAVY
TOWARD DARK A MAN WENT IN TO BUY A LAMP
HE FOUND THE PLACE WITHOUT A LIGHT IN IT STUMBLED OVER SOMETHING ON THE FLOOR AND THERE WAS ALI'S BODY WITH THE HEAD BUSTED IN AND THIS HEAVY CANDLESTICK NEAR IT
SURE HELD SO TIGHT WE COULD HARDLY GET IT OUT
MAYBE THE FIGHT WAS ABOUT WHO OWNED THE WATCH FOR THE DAGOS TALKED IN THEIR FOREIGN LINGO AND NONE OF THE NEIGHBORS COULD TELL WHAT THEY WERE SAYIN I SEE
AND THE WATCH HAVE YOU IT YES IT'S HERE
THAT'S THE WATCH ANNOUNCED THE HEADQUARTERS DETECTIVE REACHING IN FOR IT GOING YET SEE
YOU'RE NOT AS SQUEAMISH AS ALL THAT ARE YOU JUST BECAUSE IT WAS IN A DEAD MAN'S HAND AND IN A WOMAN'S
AND DONOVAN'S VOICE WAS PLAINLY SKEPTICAL
YES IT MAY HAVE SOME ROUGH EDGES ON IT
AND I'VE READ ENOUGH ABOUT GERMS TO KNOW THE DANGER I'D ADVISE YOU TO BE CAREFUL
IF YOU DON'T MIND I SHOULD LIKE TO EXAMINE THIS A BIT
BEFORE THE BIG WIND IN IRELAND SUGGESTED THONG WITH A NOD AT HIS IRISH COMPATRIOT SLIGHTLY LAUGHED THE COLONEL
THAT'S RIGHT AGREED THE COLONEL AS HE CONTINUED TO MOVE HIS MAGNIFYING GLASS OVER THE SURFACE OF THE STILL TICKING WATCH
AND A CLOSE OBSERVER MIGHT HAVE OBSERVED THAT HE DID NOT TOUCH HIS BARE FINGERS TO THE TIMEPIECE BUT POKED IT ABOUT AND TOUCHED IT HERE AND THERE WITH THE END OF A LEADPENCIL
AND DONOVAN TAKE A FRIEND'S ADVICE AND DON'T BE TOO FREE WITH THAT WATCH TOO FREE WITH IT
ASKED THE SURPRISED DETECTIVE YES
DON'T SCRATCH YOURSELF ON IT WHATEVER YOU DO WHY NOT
SIMPLY BECAUSE THIS WATCH
SOME ONE OUT HERE TO SEE YOU
ALL RIGHT BE THERE IN A SECOND
SINGA PHUT WAS THE PANTING ANSWER
I WANT TO TALK OVER DARCY'S CASE WITH YOU THE COLONEL HAD SAID AND THE TWO HAD TALKED HAD THOUGHT HAD TALKED AGAIN AND NOW WERE SILENT FOR A TIME
WHAT ARE THE CHANCES OF GETTING HIM OFF LEGALLY IF WE GO AT IT FROM A NEGATIVE STANDPOINT ASKED THE COLONEL
RATHER A HYPOTHETICAL QUESTION COLONEL BUT I SHOULD SAY IT MIGHT BE A FIFTY FIFTY PROPOSITION
AT BEST HE WOULD GET OFF WITH A SCOTCH VERDICT OF NOT PROVEN BUT HE DOESN'T WANT THAT NOR DO I
AND YOU I DON'T WANT IT EITHER
BUT I WANT TO KNOW JUST WHERE WE STAND NOW I KNOW
BUT I NEED TO DO A LITTLE MORE SMOKING OUT FIRST NOW I WANT TO THINK
IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME I'LL PRETEND I'M FISHING AND I MAY CATCH SOMETHING
IN FACT I HAVE A FEELING THAT I'LL LAND MY FISH
I'D RECOMMEND HIM TO YOU INSTEAD OF BLACKSTONE THANKS LAUGHED KENNETH
WHAT IS IT PERHAPS I CAN HELP YOU
THE OLD ADAGE OF TWO HEADS YOU KNOW
YES IT STILL HOLDS GOOD
NO ALIMONY REPEATED THE COLONEL PUZZLED YES JUST THAT
AND THERE'S NO REASON YOU SHOULDN'T KNOW
CHUCKLED THE COLONEL AS HE SKILFULLY PLAYED THE LUCKLESS TROUT NOW STRUGGLING TO GET LOOSE FROM THE HOOK
AND WHEN THE FISH WAS LANDED PANTING ON THE GRASS AND SHAG HAD BEEN ROUSED FROM HIS SLUMBER TO SLIP THE NOW LIMP FISH INTO THE CREEL COLONEL ASHLEY GAVE A SIGH OF RELIEF AND REMARKED I THINK I SEE IT NOW
THE REASON SHE ASKED NO ALIMONY INQUIRED KENNETH
NO I WASN'T THINKING OF THAT
HOWEVER DON'T THINK I'M NOT INTERESTED IN YOUR CASE I'VE FISHED ENOUGH FOR TO DAY
WELL I DON'T KNOW THAT YOU CAN
IT ISN'T GENERALLY KNOWN WENT ON THE LAWYER THAT THE HOTEL KEEPER'S WIFE HAS LEFT HIM
IT WAS ONE OF WHAT AT FIRST MIGHT BE CALLED REFINED CRUELTY ON HER HUSBAND'S PART DEGENERATING GRADUALLY INTO THAT OF THE BASER SORT
YOU DON'T MEAN THAT LARCH STRUCK HER THAT THERE WAS PHYSICAL ABUSE DO YOU ASKED THE COLONEL THAT'S WHAT HE DID
THE COLONEL DID NOT DISCLOSE THE FACT THAT IT WAS NO NEWS TO HIM
AARON GRAFTON'S STATEMENT WAS BEING UNEXPECTEDLY CONFIRMED
HE REMEMBERED THAT CYNTHIA AND GRAFTON HAD ONCE BEEN IN LOVE WITH EACH OTHER
SHE SAID HE HAD STRUCK HER MORE THAN ONCE AND SHE COULD STAND IT NO LONGER
BECAUSE LARCH MADE NO DEFENSE
LARCH BY REFUSING TO APPEAR PRACTICALLY ADMITTED THE CHARGES AGAINST HIM AND DID NOT OPPOSE THE SEPARATION
SO I HAD TO LET HER HAVE HER WAY AND WE DID NOT ASK THE COURT FOR MONEY THOUGH I HAD NO SUCH SQUEAMISH FEELINGS WHEN IT CAME TO MY COUNSEL FEE
NO BUT HE WILL OR I'LL SUE HIM AND GET JUDGMENT OH HE'LL PAY ALL RIGHT
AND IT TAKES ALL SORTS OF PERSONS TO MAKE IT UP
STILL I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW
THE MURDER OF MISSUS DARCY HAD SOME TIME AGO BEEN SHIFTED OFF THE FRONT PAGE THOUGH IT WOULD GET BACK THERE WHEN THE YOUNG JEWELER WAS TRIED
IT HAD A DOUBLE REPUTATION SO TO SPEAK
GRAVE AND EVEN REVEREND CONVENTIONS ASSEMBLED IN ITS BALLROOM AND POLITICIANS OF THE UPPER IF NOT BETTER CLASS WERE FREQUENTLY SEEN IN ITS DINING ROOM OR CAFE
LARCH HIMSELF WAS A PECULIAR CHARACTER
IN A SMALLER PLACE HE WOULD HAVE BEEN CALLED A SALOON KEEPER
AND IT WAS THIS MAN RICH IT WAS SAID HANDSOME CERTAINLY THAT CYNTHIA RATCHFORD HAD MARRIED
TO THIS WAS THE ANSWER WHISPERED MONEY
AND IN A WAY IT WAS TRUE
SHE ALSO SAW AN OPPORTUNITY OF PAYING OLD DEBTS AND REAPING SOME REVENGES
AFTER THE MARRIAGE WHICH WAS A BRILLIANT AND GAY ONE IF NOT HAPPY THE LARCH HOTEL IT COULD HARDLY BE CALLED A HOME BECAME THE SCENE OF MANY FESTIVE OCCASIONS
THEN IT WAS SAID OF LARCH THAT SOON AFTER THE ECHOES OF THE WEDDING CHIMES HAD DIED AWAY HE HAD BEGUN TO TREAT HIS WIFE WITH REFINED CRUELTY THAT HIDDEN AWAY FROM THE PUBLIC UNDERNEATH HIS HABITUAL MANNER THERE WAS THE RAWNESS OF THE BRUTE
BUT IT WAS NOTICED THAT THE OLDER AND MORE CONSERVATIVE FAMILIES WERE LESS OFTEN REPRESENTED AND WHEN THEY WERE IT WAS BY SOME OF THE YOUNGER MEMBERS WHOSE REPUTATIONS WERE ALREADY SMIRCHED OR WHO HAD NOT YET ACQUIRED ANY AND WERE WILLING TO TAKE A CHANCE
IT WOULDN'T DO YOU KNOW AFTER THAT STORY CAME OUT FOR ME AND THE VICE CHANCELLOR WHO SAT IN THE CASE AS WELL AS OTHER JUDGES AND MEMBERS OF THE BAR TO BE SEEN THERE KENNETH EXPLAINED TO THE COLONEL
MEANWHILE COLONEL ASHLEY WAS A VERY BUSY MAN AND TO NO ONE DID HE TELL VERY MUCH ABOUT HIS ACTIVITIES HE SAW DARCY FREQUENTLY AT THE JAIL AND TO THAT YOUNG MAN'S PLEADINGS THAT SOMETHING BE DONE ALWAYS RETURNED THE ANSWER
DON'T WORRY IT WILL COME OUT ALL RIGHT
I'M GOING TO RECTIFY THEM BUT IT WILL TAKE TIME
IT'S HARD FOR MISS MASON TOO ALTHOUGH SHE'S BEARING UP LIKE A MAJOR
SO KING GOT BAIL WHO PUT IT UP
IT WAS HIGH LARCH
THEY TOOK HARRY AWAY A WHILE AGO
BUT HIS ARE PRETTY UNCERTAIN SHOES TO BE IN JUST THE SAME
ONLY THAT I DARCY HESITATED AND GREW RED
GOOD EVENING COLONEL HE CALLED GENIALLY WILL YOU JOIN ME IN A WELSH RABBIT
THANK YOU NO
I'M AFRAID MY DIGESTION ISN'T QUITE UP TO THAT AS I'VE HAD TO CUT OUT MY FISHING OF LATE
NOW AS TO CERTAIN MATTERS IN THE STORE ON THE MORNING OF THE MURDER
THE STOPPED CLOCKS FOR INSTANCE HAVE YOU ANY THEORY
THERE WERE THREE OF THEM THE CENTER FIGURE BEING THAT OF HARRY KING AND HE WAS VERY MUCH INTOXICATED
THAT IS NOT ALWAYS BUT SOMETIMES IT HAPPENED TO BE SO NOW
I BEG YOUR PARDON HE SAID IN THE CULTURED TONES HE KNEW SO WELL HOW TO USE YET OF WHICH HE MADE SO LITTLE USE OF LATE
I SAID WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN REMARKED THE OTHER WE'VE MISSED YOU
I SAID I WAS GOLFING HE WENT ON EXCEEDINGLY DISTINCTLY THOUGH WITH AN EFFORT
WHY POLONIUS SOME ONE ASKED
BECAUSE DEAR FRIEND REPLIED KING SOFTLY HE SOMEWHAT RESEMBLES A CERTAIN PERSON HERE WHO TALKS TOO MUCH BUT WHO IS NOT SO WISE AS HE THINKS
THERE WAS A RATTLE OF COINS ON THE MAHOGANY BAR AS KING SOUGHT TO DISENTANGLE A SINGLE BILL FROM THE WADDED UP CURRENCY IN HIS POCKET
IT'S IT'S AN ODD COIN AN OLD ROMAN ONE THAT MISSUS DARCY HAD IN HER PRIVATE COLLECTION KEPT IN THE JEWELRY STORE SAFE WAS THE WHISPERED ANSWER
I WENT OVER THEM THE OTHER DAY AND NOTICED SOME WERE MISSING THOUGH I SAW THEM ALL WHEN I PAID A VISIT TO HER JUST A SHORT TIME BEFORE SHE WAS KILLED
THAT WAS HERS WENT ON THE JEWELER
NOW HARRY KING HAS IT EXCLAIMED COLONEL ASHLEY
THEN SHOULD ANYTHING APPEAR TO MERIT A MORE MINUTE EXAMINATION ALBERT DE MORCERF COULD FOLLOW UP HIS RESEARCHES BY MEANS OF A SMALL GATE SIMILAR TO THAT CLOSE TO THE CONCIERGE'S DOOR AND WHICH MERITS A PARTICULAR DESCRIPTION
SHRUBS AND CREEPING PLANTS COVERED THE WINDOWS AND HID FROM THE GARDEN AND COURT THESE TWO APARTMENTS THE ONLY ROOMS INTO WHICH AS THEY WERE ON THE GROUND FLOOR THE PRYING EYES OF THE CURIOUS COULD PENETRATE
AT A QUARTER TO TEN A VALET ENTERED HE COMPOSED WITH A LITTLE GROOM NAMED JOHN AND WHO ONLY SPOKE ENGLISH ALL ALBERT'S ESTABLISHMENT ALTHOUGH THE COOK OF THE HOTEL WAS ALWAYS AT HIS SERVICE AND ON GREAT OCCASIONS THE COUNT'S CHASSEUR ALSO
WAIT THEN DURING THE DAY TELL ROSA THAT WHEN I LEAVE THE OPERA I WILL SUP WITH HER AS SHE WISHES
VERY WELL AT HALF PAST TEN
IS THE COUNTESS UP YET
THE VALET LEFT THE ROOM
GOOD MORNING LUCIEN GOOD MORNING SAID ALBERT YOUR PUNCTUALITY REALLY ALARMS ME
YOU WHOM I EXPECTED LAST YOU ARRIVE AT FIVE MINUTES TO TEN WHEN THE TIME FIXED WAS HALF PAST
NO NO MY DEAR FELLOW DO NOT CONFOUND OUR PLANS
YES HE HAS NOT MUCH TO COMPLAIN OF BOURGES IS THE CAPITAL OF CHARLES SEVEN
IT IS FOR THAT REASON YOU SEE ME SO EARLY
I RETURNED HOME AT DAYBREAK AND STROVE TO SLEEP BUT MY HEAD ACHED AND I GOT UP TO HAVE A RIDE FOR AN HOUR
PESTE I WILL DO NOTHING OF THE KIND THE MOMENT THEY COME FROM GOVERNMENT YOU WOULD FIND THEM EXECRABLE
BESIDES THAT DOES NOT CONCERN THE HOME BUT THE FINANCIAL DEPARTMENT
ABOUT WHAT ABOUT THE PAPERS
IN THE ENTIRE POLITICAL WORLD OF WHICH YOU ARE ONE OF THE LEADERS
THEY SAY THAT IT IS QUITE FAIR AND THAT SOWING SO MUCH RED YOU OUGHT TO REAP A LITTLE BLUE
COME COME THAT IS NOT BAD SAID LUCIEN
WITH YOUR TALENTS YOU WOULD MAKE YOUR FORTUNE IN THREE OR FOUR YEARS
FRANZ WHO SEEMED ATTRACTED BY SOME INVISIBLE INFLUENCE TOWARDS THE COUNT IN WHICH TERROR WAS STRANGELY MINGLED FELT AN EXTREME RELUCTANCE TO PERMIT HIS FRIEND TO BE EXPOSED ALONE TO THE SINGULAR FASCINATION THAT THIS MYSTERIOUS PERSONAGE SEEMED TO EXERCISE OVER HIM AND THEREFORE MADE NO OBJECTION TO ALBERT'S REQUEST BUT AT ONCE ACCOMPANIED HIM TO THE DESIRED SPOT AND AFTER A SHORT DELAY THE COUNT JOINED THEM IN THE SALON
MY VERY GOOD FRIEND AND EXCELLENT NEIGHBOR REPLIED THE COUNT WITH A SMILE YOU REALLY EXAGGERATE MY TRIFLING EXERTIONS
MY FATHER THE COMTE DE MORCERF ALTHOUGH OF SPANISH ORIGIN POSSESSES CONSIDERABLE INFLUENCE BOTH AT THE COURT OF FRANCE AND MADRID AND I UNHESITATINGLY PLACE THE BEST SERVICES OF MYSELF AND ALL TO WHOM MY LIFE IS DEAR AT YOUR DISPOSAL
I CAN SCARCELY CREDIT IT
THEN IT IS SETTLED SAID THE COUNT AND I GIVE YOU MY SOLEMN ASSURANCE THAT I ONLY WAITED AN OPPORTUNITY LIKE THE PRESENT TO REALIZE PLANS THAT I HAVE LONG MEDITATED
SHALL WE MAKE A POSITIVE APPOINTMENT FOR A PARTICULAR DAY AND HOUR INQUIRED THE COUNT ONLY LET ME WARN YOU THAT I AM PROVERBIAL FOR MY PUNCTILIOUS EXACTITUDE IN KEEPING MY ENGAGEMENTS DAY FOR DAY HOUR FOR HOUR SAID ALBERT THAT WILL SUIT ME TO A DOT
SO BE IT THEN REPLIED THE COUNT AND EXTENDING HIS HAND TOWARDS A CALENDAR SUSPENDED NEAR THE CHIMNEY PIECE HE SAID TO DAY IS THE TWENTY FIRST OF FEBRUARY AND DRAWING OUT HIS WATCH ADDED IT IS EXACTLY HALF PAST TEN O'CLOCK NOW PROMISE ME TO REMEMBER THIS AND EXPECT ME THE TWENTY FIRST OF MAY AT THE SAME HOUR IN THE FORENOON
I RESIDE IN MY FATHER'S HOUSE BUT OCCUPY A PAVILION AT THE FARTHER SIDE OF THE COURT YARD ENTIRELY SEPARATED FROM THE MAIN BUILDING
NOW THEN SAID THE COUNT RETURNING HIS TABLETS TO HIS POCKET MAKE YOURSELF PERFECTLY EASY THE HAND OF YOUR TIME PIECE WILL NOT BE MORE ACCURATE IN MARKING THE TIME THAN MYSELF
THAT DEPENDS WHEN DO YOU LEAVE
FOR FRANCE NO FOR VENICE I SHALL REMAIN IN ITALY FOR ANOTHER YEAR OR TWO
THEN WE SHALL NOT MEET IN PARIS
I FEAR I SHALL NOT HAVE THAT HONOR
WELL SINCE WE MUST PART SAID THE COUNT HOLDING OUT A HAND TO EACH OF THE YOUNG MEN ALLOW ME TO WISH YOU BOTH A SAFE AND PLEASANT JOURNEY
WHAT IS THE MATTER ASKED ALBERT OF FRANZ WHEN THEY HAD RETURNED TO THEIR OWN APARTMENTS YOU SEEM MORE THAN COMMONLY THOUGHTFUL
I WILL CONFESS TO YOU ALBERT REPLIED FRANZ THE COUNT IS A VERY SINGULAR PERSON AND THE APPOINTMENT YOU HAVE MADE TO MEET HIM IN PARIS FILLS ME WITH A THOUSAND APPREHENSIONS
DID YOU EVER MEET HIM PREVIOUSLY TO COMING HITHER
UPON MY HONOR THEN LISTEN TO ME
HE DWELT WITH CONSIDERABLE FORCE AND ENERGY ON THE ALMOST MAGICAL HOSPITALITY HE HAD RECEIVED FROM THE COUNT AND THE MAGNIFICENCE OF HIS ENTERTAINMENT IN THE GROTTO OF THE THOUSAND AND ONE NIGHTS HE RECOUNTED WITH CIRCUMSTANTIAL EXACTITUDE ALL THE PARTICULARS OF THE SUPPER THE HASHISH THE STATUES THE DREAM AND HOW AT HIS AWAKENING THERE REMAINED NO PROOF OR TRACE OF ALL THESE EVENTS SAVE THE SMALL YACHT SEEN IN THE DISTANT HORIZON DRIVING UNDER FULL SAIL TOWARD PORTO VECCHIO
THEN HE DETAILED THE CONVERSATION OVERHEARD BY HIM AT THE COLOSSEUM BETWEEN THE COUNT AND VAMPA IN WHICH THE COUNT HAD PROMISED TO OBTAIN THE RELEASE OF THE BANDIT PEPPINO AN ENGAGEMENT WHICH AS OUR READERS ARE AWARE HE MOST FAITHFULLY FULFILLED
BUT SAID FRANZ THE CORSICAN BANDITS THAT WERE AMONG THE CREW OF HIS VESSEL
WHY REALLY THE THING SEEMS TO ME SIMPLE ENOUGH
TALKING OF COUNTRIES REPLIED FRANZ OF WHAT COUNTRY IS THE COUNT WHAT IS HIS NATIVE TONGUE WHENCE DOES HE DERIVE HIS IMMENSE FORTUNE AND WHAT WERE THOSE EVENTS OF HIS EARLY LIFE A LIFE AS MARVELLOUS AS UNKNOWN THAT HAVE TINCTURED HIS SUCCEEDING YEARS WITH SO DARK AND GLOOMY A MISANTHROPY
CERTAINLY THESE ARE QUESTIONS THAT IN YOUR PLACE I SHOULD LIKE TO HAVE ANSWERED
MY DEAR FRANZ REPLIED ALBERT WHEN UPON RECEIPT OF MY LETTER YOU FOUND THE NECESSITY OF ASKING THE COUNT'S ASSISTANCE YOU PROMPTLY WENT TO HIM SAYING MY FRIEND ALBERT DE MORCERF IS IN DANGER HELP ME TO DELIVER HIM
WHAT ARE HIS MEANS OF EXISTENCE WHAT IS HIS BIRTHPLACE OF WHAT COUNTRY IS HE A NATIVE
I CONFESS HE ASKED ME NONE NO HE MERELY CAME AND FREED ME FROM THE HANDS OF SIGNOR VAMPA WHERE I CAN ASSURE YOU IN SPITE OF ALL MY OUTWARD APPEARANCE OF EASE AND UNCONCERN I DID NOT VERY PARTICULARLY CARE TO REMAIN
AND THIS TIME IT MUST BE CONFESSED THAT CONTRARY TO THE USUAL STATE OF AFFAIRS IN DISCUSSIONS BETWEEN THE YOUNG MEN THE EFFECTIVE ARGUMENTS WERE ALL ON ALBERT'S SIDE
WELL SAID FRANZ WITH A SIGH DO AS YOU PLEASE MY DEAR VISCOUNT FOR YOUR ARGUMENTS ARE BEYOND MY POWERS OF REFUTATION
AND NOW MY DEAR FRANZ LET US TALK OF SOMETHING ELSE
THEY'RE DONE FOR SAID THE SCHOOLMASTER IN A LOW KEY TO THE CHOUETTE OUT WITH YOUR VITRIOL AND MIND YOUR EYE
THE TWO MONSTERS TOOK OFF THEIR SHOES AND MOVED STEALTHILY ALONG KEEPING IN THE SHADOWS OF THE HOUSES
BY MEANS OF THIS STRATAGEM THEY FOLLOWED SO CLOSELY THAT ALTHOUGH WITHIN A FEW STEPS OF SARAH AND TOM THEY DID NOT HEAR THEM
SARAH AND HER BROTHER HAVING AGAIN PASSED BY THE TAPIS FRANC ARRIVED CLOSE TO THE DILAPIDATED HOUSE WHICH WAS PARTLY IN RUINS AND ITS OPENED CELLARS FORMED A KIND OF GULF ALONG WHICH THE STREET RAN IN THAT DIRECTION
IN AN INSTANT THE SCHOOLMASTER WITH A LEAP RESEMBLING IN STRENGTH AND AGILITY THE SPRING OF A TIGER SEIZED SEYTON WITH ONE HAND BY THE THROAT AND EXCLAIMED YOUR MONEY OR I WILL FLING YOU INTO THIS HOLE
NO SAID THE OLD BRUTE GRUMBLINGLY NO NOT ONE RING WHAT A SHAME
TOM SEYTON DID NOT LOSE HIS PRESENCE OF MIND DURING THIS SCENE RAPIDLY AND UNEXPECTEDLY AS IT HAD OCCURRED
OH AH TO LAY A TRAP TO CATCH US REPLIED THE THIEF
THEN ADDRESSING THOMAS SEYTON YOU KNOW THE PLAIN OF SAINT DENIS
DID YOU SEE IN THE CABARET WE HAVE JUST LEFT FOR I KNOW YOU AGAIN THE MAN WHOM THE CHARCOAL MAN CAME TO SEEK
CRIED THE SCHOOLMASTER A THOUSAND FRANCS AND I'LL KILL HIM
WRETCH I DO NOT SEEK HIS LIFE REPLIED SARAH TO THE SCHOOLMASTER
LET'S GO AND MEET HIM
OLD BOY IT WILL PAY FOR LOOKING AFTER
WELL MY WIFE SHALL BE THERE SAID THE SCHOOLMASTER YOU WILL TELL HER WHAT YOU WANT AND I SHALL SEE
IN THE PLAIN OF SAINT DENIS
BETWEEN SAINT OUEN AND THE ROAD OF LA REVOLTE AT THE END OF THE ROAD AGREED
HE HAD FORGOTTEN THE ADDRESS OF THE SELF STYLED FAN PAINTER
THE FIACRE STARTED
WHITHER HATH MY LONESOMENESS GONE SPAKE HE
MY SHADOW CALLETH ME
WHAT MATTER ABOUT MY SHADOW
LET IT RUN AFTER ME I RUN AWAY FROM IT
THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA TO HIS HEART AND RAN AWAY
VERILY MY FOLLY HATH GROWN BIG IN THE MOUNTAINS
NOW DO I HEAR SIX OLD FOOLS LEGS RATTLING BEHIND ONE ANOTHER
BUT DOTH ZARATHUSTRA NEED TO BE FRIGHTENED BY HIS SHADOW
ALSO METHINKETH THAT AFTER ALL IT HATH LONGER LEGS THAN MINE
FOR WHEN ZARATHUSTRA SCRUTINISED HIM WITH HIS GLANCE HE WAS FRIGHTENED AS BY A SUDDEN APPARITION SO SLENDER SWARTHY HOLLOW AND WORN OUT DID THIS FOLLOWER APPEAR
ASKED ZARATHUSTRA VEHEMENTLY WHAT DOEST THOU HERE
AND WHY CALLEST THOU THYSELF MY SHADOW
THOU ART NOT PLEASING UNTO ME
MUST I EVER BE ON THE WAY
O EARTH THOU HAST BECOME TOO ROUND FOR ME
WHEN THE DEVIL CASTETH HIS SKIN DOTH NOT HIS NAME ALSO FALL AWAY IT IS ALSO SKIN
THE DEVIL HIMSELF IS PERHAPS SKIN
SOMETIMES I MEANT TO LIE AND BEHOLD
THEN ONLY DID I HIT THE TRUTH
HOW HAVE I STILL INCLINATION
HAVE I STILL A GOAL
A HAVEN TOWARDS WHICH MY SAIL IS SET
FOR IT DO I ASK AND SEEK AND HAVE SOUGHT BUT HAVE NOT FOUND IT
O ETERNAL EVERYWHERE O ETERNAL NOWHERE O ETERNAL IN VAIN
THOU ART MY SHADOW
SAID HE AT LAST SADLY
THY DANGER IS NOT SMALL THOU FREE SPIRIT AND WANDERER
THEY SLEEP QUIETLY THEY ENJOY THEIR NEW SECURITY
BEWARE LEST IN THE END A NARROW FAITH CAPTURE THEE A HARD RIGOROUS DELUSION
FOR NOW EVERYTHING THAT IS NARROW AND FIXED SEDUCETH AND TEMPTETH THEE
THOU HAST LOST THY GOAL
THOU POOR ROVER AND RAMBLER THOU TIRED BUTTERFLY
WILT THOU HAVE A REST AND A HOME THIS EVENING
THUS ACCOMPLISHED HE EXCITED THE ADMIRATION OF EVERY SILLY COQUETTE AND THE ENVY OF EVERY FLUTTERING COXCOMB BUT BY ALL YOUNG GENTLEMEN AND LADIES OF UNDERSTANDING HE WAS HEARTILY DESPISED AS A MERE CIVILIZED MONKEY
THAT HIS SOUL MIGHT AFTERWARDS OCCUPY SUCH A STATION AS WOULD BE MOST SUITABLE TO HIS CHARACTER IT WAS SENTENCED TO INHABIT THE BODY OF THAT FINICAL GRINNING AND MISCHIEVOUS LITTLE MIMICK WITH FOUR LEGS WHICH YOU NOW BEHOLD BEFORE YOU
ONCE UPON A TIME A BRAHMAN WHO WAS WALKING ALONG THE ROAD CAME UPON AN IRON CAGE IN WHICH A GREAT TIGER HAD BEEN SHUT UP BY THE VILLAGERS WHO CAUGHT HIM
THE BRAHMAN ANSWERED NO I WILL NOT FOR IF I LET YOU OUT OF THE CAGE YOU WILL EAT ME
OH FATHER OF MERCY ANSWERED THE TIGER IN TRUTH THAT I WILL NOT
I WILL NEVER BE SO UNGRATEFUL ONLY LET ME OUT THAT I MAY DRINK SOME WATER AND RETURN
THEN THE BRAHMAN TOOK PITY ON HIM AND OPENED THE CAGE DOOR BUT NO SOONER HAD HE DONE SO THAN THE TIGER JUMPING OUT SAID NOW I WILL EAT YOU FIRST AND DRINK THE WATER AFTERWARDS
SO THE BRAHMAN AND THE TIGER WALKED ON TILL THEY CAME TO A BANYAN TREE AND THE BRAHMAN SAID TO IT BANYAN TREE BANYAN TREE HEAR AND GIVE JUDGMENT
ON WHAT MUST I GIVE JUDGMENT ASKED THE BANYAN TREE
THIS TIGER SAID THE BRAHMAN BEGGED ME TO LET HIM OUT OF HIS CAGE TO DRINK A LITTLE WATER AND HE PROMISED NOT TO HURT ME IF I DID SO BUT NOW THAT I HAVE LET HIM OUT HE WISHES TO EAT ME
IS IT JUST THAT HE SHOULD DO SO OR NO
LET THE TIGER EAT THE MAN FOR MEN ARE AN UNGRATEFUL RACE
SIR CAMEL SIR CAMEL CRIED THE BRAHMAN HEAR AND GIVE JUDGMENT
AT A LITTLE DISTANCE THEY FOUND A BULLOCK LYING BY THE ROADSIDE
IS IT FAIR THAT HE SHOULD DO SO OR NOT
LET THE TIGER EAT THE MAN FOR MEN HAVE NO PITY
THREE OUT OF THE SIX HAD GIVEN JUDGMENT AGAINST THE BRAHMAN BUT STILL HE DID NOT LOSE ALL HOPE AND DETERMINED TO ASK THE OTHER THREE
ON WHAT MUST I GIVE JUDGMENT ASKED THE EAGLE
THE BRAHMAN STATED THE CASE AND THE EAGLE ANSWERED WHENEVER MEN SEE ME THEY TRY TO SHOOT ME THEY CLIMB THE ROCKS AND STEAL AWAY MY LITTLE ONES
THEN THE TIGER BEGAN TO ROAR AND SAID THE JUDGMENT OF ALL IS AGAINST YOU O BRAHMAN
AFTER THIS THEY SAW AN ALLIGATOR AND THE BRAHMAN RELATED THE MATTER TO HIM HOPING FOR A MORE FAVORABLE VERDICT
BUT THE ALLIGATOR SAID WHENEVER I PUT MY NOSE OUT OF THE WATER MEN TORMENT ME AND TRY TO KILL ME
THE BRAHMAN GAVE HIMSELF UP AS LOST BUT AGAIN HE PRAYED THE TIGER TO HAVE PATIENCE AND LET HIM ASK THE OPINION OF THE SIXTH JUDGE
NOW THE SIXTH WAS A JACKAL
THE BRAHMAN TOLD HIS STORY AND SAID TO HIM UNCLE JACKAL UNCLE JACKAL SAY WHAT IS YOUR JUDGMENT
SHOW ME THE PLACE
WHEN THEY GOT THERE THE JACKAL SAID NOW BRAHMAN SHOW ME EXACTLY WHERE YOU STOOD
EXACTLY THERE WAS IT ASKED THE JACKAL
EXACTLY HERE REPLIED THE BRAHMAN
WHERE WAS THE TIGER THEN
WHY I STOOD SO SAID THE TIGER JUMPING INTO THE CAGE AND MY HEAD WAS ON THIS SIDE
VERY GOOD SAID THE JACKAL BUT I CANNOT JUDGE WITHOUT UNDERSTANDING THE WHOLE MATTER EXACTLY
SHUT AND BOLTED SAID THE BRAHMAN
THEN SHUT AND BOLT IT SAID THE JACKAL
WHEN THE BRAHMAN HAD DONE THIS THE JACKAL SAID OH YOU WICKED AND UNGRATEFUL TIGER
WHEN THE GOOD BRAHMAN OPENED YOUR CAGE DOOR IS TO EAT HIM THE ONLY RETURN YOU WOULD MAKE
PROCEED ON YOUR JOURNEY FRIEND BRAHMAN
YOUR ROAD LIES THAT WAY AND MINE THIS
WHAT HATH HAPPENED UNTO ME
HE ASKED HIMSELF SOMETHING WARM AND LIVING QUICKENETH ME IT MUST BE IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD
WHEN HOWEVER ZARATHUSTRA WAS QUITE NIGH UNTO THEM THEN DID HE HEAR PLAINLY THAT A HUMAN VOICE SPAKE IN THE MIDST OF THE KINE AND APPARENTLY ALL OF THEM HAD TURNED THEIR HEADS TOWARDS THE SPEAKER
WHAT DO I HERE SEEK
ANSWERED HE THE SAME THAT THOU SEEKEST THOU MISCHIEF MAKER THAT IS TO SAY HAPPINESS UPON EARTH
FOR I TELL THEE THAT I HAVE ALREADY TALKED HALF A MORNING UNTO THEM AND JUST NOW WERE THEY ABOUT TO GIVE ME THEIR ANSWER
HE WOULD NOT BE RID OF HIS AFFLICTION
WHO HATH NOT AT PRESENT HIS HEART HIS MOUTH AND HIS EYES FULL OF DISGUST
THOU ALSO THOU ALSO
BUT BEHOLD THESE KINE
THE KINE HOWEVER GAZED AT IT ALL AND WONDERED
WANTON AVIDITY BILIOUS ENVY CAREWORN REVENGE POPULACE PRIDE ALL THESE STRUCK MINE EYE
IT IS NO LONGER TRUE THAT THE POOR ARE BLESSED
THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN HOWEVER IS WITH THE KINE AND WHY IS IT NOT WITH THE RICH
WHY DOST THOU TEMPT ME
ANSWERED THE OTHER
THOU KNOWEST IT THYSELF BETTER EVEN THAN I
THUS SPAKE THE PEACEFUL ONE AND PUFFED HIMSELF AND PERSPIRED WITH HIS WORDS SO THAT THE KINE WONDERED ANEW
THOU DOEST VIOLENCE TO THYSELF THOU PREACHER ON THE MOUNT WHEN THOU USEST SUCH SEVERE WORDS
THEY ALSO ABSTAIN FROM ALL HEAVY THOUGHTS WHICH INFLATE THE HEART
WELL
SAID ZARATHUSTRA THOU SHOULDST ALSO SEE MINE ANIMALS MINE EAGLE AND MY SERPENT THEIR LIKE DO NOT AT PRESENT EXIST ON EARTH
AND TALK TO MINE ANIMALS OF THE HAPPINESS OF ANIMALS
NOW HOWEVER TAKE LEAVE AT ONCE OF THY KINE THOU STRANGE ONE
THOU AMIABLE ONE
FOR THEY ARE THY WARMEST FRIENDS AND PRECEPTORS
THOU EVIL FLATTERER
HE PERCEIVED THAT IT WAS NO GOOD TALKING TO THE OLD MAN AND THAT THE PRINCIPAL PERSON IN THE HOUSE WAS THE MOTHER
BEFORE HER HE DECIDED TO SCATTER HIS PEARLS
THE PRINCESS WAS DISTRACTED AND DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO DO SHE FELT SHE HAD SINNED AGAINST KITTY
WELL DOCTOR DECIDE OUR FATE SAID THE PRINCESS TELL ME EVERYTHING
IS THERE HOPE SHE MEANT TO SAY BUT HER LIPS QUIVERED AND SHE COULD NOT UTTER THE QUESTION WELL DOCTOR
AS YOU PLEASE THE PRINCESS WENT OUT WITH A SIGH
THE FAMILY DOCTOR RESPECTFULLY CEASED IN THE MIDDLE OF HIS OBSERVATIONS
AND THERE ARE INDICATIONS MALNUTRITION NERVOUS EXCITABILITY AND SO ON
THE QUESTION STANDS THUS IN PRESENCE OF INDICATIONS OF TUBERCULOUS PROCESS WHAT IS TO BE DONE TO MAINTAIN NUTRITION
YES THAT'S AN UNDERSTOOD THING RESPONDED THE CELEBRATED PHYSICIAN AGAIN GLANCING AT HIS WATCH
BEG PARDON IS THE YAUSKY BRIDGE DONE YET OR SHALL I HAVE TO DRIVE AROUND
HE ASKED AH IT IS
OH WELL THEN I CAN DO IT IN TWENTY MINUTES
AND HOW ABOUT A TOUR ABROAD ASKED THE FAMILY DOCTOR
WHAT IS WANTED IS MEANS OF IMPROVING NUTRITION AND NOT FOR LOWERING IT
THE FAMILY DOCTOR LISTENED ATTENTIVELY AND RESPECTFULLY
BUT IN FAVOR OF FOREIGN TRAVEL I WOULD URGE THE CHANGE OF HABITS THE REMOVAL FROM CONDITIONS CALLING UP REMINISCENCES
AND THEN THE MOTHER WISHES IT HE ADDED
AH WELL IN THAT CASE TO BE SURE LET THEM GO ONLY THOSE GERMAN QUACKS ARE MISCHIEVOUS
OH TIME'S UP ALREADY AND HE WENT TO THE DOOR
THE CELEBRATED DOCTOR ANNOUNCED TO THE PRINCESS A FEELING OF WHAT WAS DUE FROM HIM DICTATED HIS DOING SO THAT HE OUGHT TO SEE THE PATIENT ONCE MORE
OH NO ONLY A FEW DETAILS PRINCESS COME THIS WAY
AND THE MOTHER ACCOMPANIED BY THE DOCTOR WENT INTO THE DRAWING ROOM TO KITTY
WHEN THE DOCTOR CAME IN SHE FLUSHED CRIMSON AND HER EYES FILLED WITH TEARS
SHE ANSWERED HIM AND ALL AT ONCE GOT UP FURIOUS
EXCUSE ME DOCTOR BUT THERE IS REALLY NO OBJECT IN THIS
THIS IS THE THIRD TIME YOU'VE ASKED ME THE SAME THING
THE CELEBRATED DOCTOR DID NOT TAKE OFFENSE
NERVOUS IRRITABILITY HE SAID TO THE PRINCESS WHEN KITTY HAD LEFT THE ROOM HOWEVER I HAD FINISHED
AND THE DOCTOR BEGAN SCIENTIFICALLY EXPLAINING TO THE PRINCESS AS AN EXCEPTIONALLY INTELLIGENT WOMAN THE CONDITION OF THE YOUNG PRINCESS AND CONCLUDED BY INSISTING ON THE DRINKING OF THE WATERS WHICH WERE CERTAINLY HARMLESS
AT THE QUESTION SHOULD THEY GO ABROAD THE DOCTOR PLUNGED INTO DEEP MEDITATION AS THOUGH RESOLVING A WEIGHTY PROBLEM
FINALLY HIS DECISION WAS PRONOUNCED THEY WERE TO GO ABROAD BUT TO PUT NO FAITH IN FOREIGN QUACKS AND TO APPLY TO HIM IN ANY NEED
IT SEEMED AS THOUGH SOME PIECE OF GOOD FORTUNE HAD COME TO PASS AFTER THE DOCTOR HAD GONE
THE MOTHER WAS MUCH MORE CHEERFUL WHEN SHE WENT BACK TO HER DAUGHTER AND KITTY PRETENDED TO BE MORE CHEERFUL
EDUCATED PEOPLE OF THE UPPER CLASSES ARE TRYING TO STIFLE THE EVER GROWING SENSE OF THE NECESSITY OF TRANSFORMING THE EXISTING SOCIAL ORDER
THIS IS ABSOLUTELY INCORRECT
IN THE SOCIAL CONCEPTION OF LIFE IT IS SUPPOSED THAT SINCE THE AIM OF LIFE IS FOUND IN GROUPS OF INDIVIDUALS INDIVIDUALS WILL VOLUNTARILY SACRIFICE THEIR OWN INTERESTS FOR THE INTERESTS OF THE GROUP
THE CHAMPIONS OF THE SOCIAL CONCEPTION OF LIFE USUALLY TRY TO CONNECT THE IDEA OF AUTHORITY THAT IS OF VIOLENCE WITH THE IDEA OF MORAL INFLUENCE BUT THIS CONNECTION IS QUITE IMPOSSIBLE
THE MAN WHO IS CONTROLLED BY MORAL INFLUENCE ACTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH HIS OWN DESIRES
THE BASIS OF AUTHORITY IS BODILY VIOLENCE
THE POSSIBILITY OF APPLYING BODILY VIOLENCE TO PEOPLE IS PROVIDED ABOVE ALL BY AN ORGANIZATION OF ARMED MEN TRAINED TO ACT IN UNISON IN SUBMISSION TO ONE WILL
THESE BANDS OF ARMED MEN SUBMISSIVE TO A SINGLE WILL ARE WHAT CONSTITUTE THE ARMY
THE ARMY HAS ALWAYS BEEN AND STILL IS THE BASIS OF POWER
POWER IS ALWAYS IN THE HANDS OF THOSE WHO CONTROL THE ARMY AND ALL MEN IN POWER FROM THE ROMAN CAESARS TO THE RUSSIAN AND GERMAN EMPERORS TAKE MORE INTEREST IN THEIR ARMY THAN IN ANYTHING AND COURT POPULARITY IN THE ARMY KNOWING THAT IF THAT IS ON THEIR SIDE THEIR POWER IS SECURE
INDEED IT COULD NOT BE OTHERWISE
ONLY UNDER THOSE CONDITIONS COULD THE SOCIAL ORGANIZATION BE JUSTIFIED
BUT SINCE THIS IS NOT THE CASE AND ON THE CONTRARY MEN IN POWER ARE ALWAYS FAR FROM BEING SAINTS THROUGH THE VERY FACT OF THEIR POSSESSION OF POWER THE SOCIAL ORGANIZATION BASED ON POWER HAS NO JUSTIFICATION
EVEN IF THERE WAS ONCE A TIME WHEN OWING TO THE LOW STANDARD OF MORALS AND THE DISPOSITION OF MEN TO VIOLENCE THE EXISTENCE OF AN AUTHORITY TO RESTRAIN SUCH VIOLENCE WAS AN ADVANTAGE BECAUSE THE VIOLENCE OF GOVERNMENT WAS LESS THAN THE VIOLENCE OF INDIVIDUALS ONE CANNOT BUT SEE THAT THIS ADVANTAGE COULD NOT BE LASTING
BETWEEN THE MEMBERS OF ONE STATE SUBJECT TO A SINGLE AUTHORITY THE STRIFE BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS SEEMS STILL LESS AND THE LIFE OF THE STATE SEEMS EVEN MORE SECURE
IT WAS PRODUCED ON ONE HAND BY THE NATURAL GROWTH OF POPULATION AND ON THE OTHER BY STRUGGLE AND CONQUEST
AFTER CONQUEST THE POWER OF THE EMPEROR PUTS AN END TO INTERNAL DISSENSIONS AND SO THE STATE CONCEPTION OF LIFE JUSTIFIES ITSELF
BUT THIS JUSTIFICATION IS NEVER MORE THAN TEMPORARY
INTERNAL DISSENSIONS DISAPPEAR ONLY IN PROPORTION TO THE DEGREE OF OPPRESSION EXERTED BY THE AUTHORITY OVER THE DISSENTIENT INDIVIDUALS
GOVERNMENT AUTHORITY EVEN IF IT DOES SUPPRESS PRIVATE VIOLENCE ALWAYS INTRODUCES INTO THE LIFE OF MEN FRESH FORMS OF VIOLENCE WHICH TEND TO BECOME GREATER AND GREATER IN PROPORTION TO THE DURATION AND STRENGTH OF THE GOVERNMENT
AND THEREFORE THE OPPRESSION OF THE OPPRESSED ALWAYS GOES ON GROWING UP TO THE FURTHEST LIMIT BEYOND WHICH IT CANNOT GO WITHOUT KILLING THE GOOSE WITH THE GOLDEN EGGS
THE MOST CONVINCING EXAMPLE OF THIS IS TO BE FOUND IN THE CONDITION OF THE WORKING CLASSES OF OUR EPOCH WHO ARE IN REALITY NO BETTER THAN THE SLAVES OF ANCIENT TIMES SUBDUED BY CONQUEST
SO IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN
FOOTNOTE THE FACT THAT IN AMERICA THE ABUSES OF AUTHORITY EXIST IN SPITE OF THE SMALL NUMBER OF THEIR TROOPS NOT ONLY FAILS TO DISPROVE THIS POSITION BUT POSITIVELY CONFIRMS IT
THE UPPER CLASSES KNOW THAT AN ARMY OF FIFTY THOUSAND WILL SOON BE INSUFFICIENT AND NO LONGER RELYING ON PINKERTON'S MEN THEY FEEL THAT THE SECURITY OF THEIR POSITION DEPENDS ON THE INCREASED STRENGTH OF THE ARMY
THE REASON TO WHICH HE GAVE EXPRESSION IS ESSENTIALLY THE SAME AS THAT WHICH MADE THE FRENCH KINGS AND THE POPES ENGAGE SWISS AND SCOTCH GUARDS AND MAKES THE RUSSIAN AUTHORITIES OF TO DAY SO CAREFULLY DISTRIBUTE THE RECRUITS SO THAT THE REGIMENTS FROM THE FRONTIERS ARE STATIONED IN CENTRAL DISTRICTS AND THE REGIMENTS FROM THE CENTER ARE STATIONED ON THE FRONTIERS
THE MEANING OF CAPRIVI'S SPEECH PUT INTO PLAIN LANGUAGE IS THAT FUNDS ARE NEEDED NOT TO RESIST FOREIGN FOES BUT TO BUY UNDER OFFICERS TO BE READY TO ACT AGAINST THE ENSLAVED TOILING MASSES
AND THIS ABNORMAL ORDER OF THINGS IS MAINTAINED BY THE ARMY
BUT THERE IS NOT ONLY ONE GOVERNMENT THERE ARE OTHER GOVERNMENTS EXPLOITING THEIR SUBJECTS BY VIOLENCE IN THE SAME WAY AND ALWAYS READY TO POUNCE DOWN ON ANY OTHER GOVERNMENT AND CARRY OFF THE FRUITS OF THE TOIL OF ITS ENSLAVED SUBJECTS
AND SO EVERY GOVERNMENT NEEDS AN ARMY ALSO TO PROTECT ITS BOOTY FROM ITS NEIGHBOR BRIGANDS
THIS INCREASE IS CONTAGIOUS AS MONTESQUIEU POINTED OUT ONE HUNDRED FIFTY YEARS AGO
EVERY INCREASE IN THE ARMY OF ONE STATE WITH THE AIM OF SELF DEFENSE AGAINST ITS SUBJECTS BECOMES A SOURCE OF DANGER FOR NEIGHBORING STATES AND CALLS FOR A SIMILAR INCREASE IN THEIR ARMIES
THE DESPOTISM OF A GOVERNMENT ALWAYS INCREASES WITH THE STRENGTH OF THE ARMY AND ITS EXTERNAL SUCCESSES AND THE AGGRESSIVENESS OF A GOVERNMENT INCREASES WITH ITS INTERNAL DESPOTISM
THE RIVALRY OF THE EUROPEAN STATES IN CONSTANTLY INCREASING THEIR FORCES HAS REDUCED THEM TO THE NECESSITY OF HAVING RECOURSE TO UNIVERSAL MILITARY SERVICE SINCE BY THAT MEANS THE GREATEST POSSIBLE NUMBER OF SOLDIERS IS OBTAINED AT THE LEAST POSSIBLE EXPENSE
AND BY THIS MEANS ALL CITIZENS ARE UNDER ARMS TO SUPPORT THE INIQUITIES PRACTICED UPON THEM ALL CITIZENS HAVE BECOME THEIR OWN OPPRESSORS
THIS INCONSISTENCY HAS BECOME OBVIOUS IN UNIVERSAL MILITARY SERVICE
IN FACT THE WHOLE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOCIAL CONCEPTION OF LIFE CONSISTS IN MAN'S RECOGNITION OF THE BARBARITY OF STRIFE BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS AND THE TRANSITORINESS OF PERSONAL LIFE ITSELF AND THE TRANSFERENCE OF THE AIM OF LIFE TO GROUPS OF PERSONS
BUT WITH UNIVERSAL MILITARY SERVICE IT COMES TO PASS THAT MEN AFTER MAKING EVERY SACRIFICE TO GET RID OF THE CRUELTY OF STRIFE AND THE INSECURITY OF EXISTENCE ARE CALLED UPON TO FACE ALL THE PERILS THEY HAD MEANT TO AVOID
BUT INSTEAD OF DOING THAT THEY EXPOSE THE INDIVIDUALS TO THE SAME NECESSITY OF STRIFE SUBSTITUTING STRIFE WITH INDIVIDUALS OF OTHER STATES FOR STRIFE WITH NEIGHBORS
THE TAXES RAISED FROM THE PEOPLE FOR WAR PREPARATIONS ABSORB THE GREATER PART OF THE PRODUCE OF LABOR WHICH THE ARMY OUGHT TO DEFEND
THE DANGER OF WAR EVER READY TO BREAK OUT RENDERS ALL REFORMS OF LIFE SOCIAL LIFE VAIN AND FRUITLESS
BUT THE FATAL SIGNIFICANCE OF UNIVERSAL MILITARY SERVICE AS THE MANIFESTATION OF THE CONTRADICTION INHERENT IN THE SOCIAL CONCEPTION OF LIFE IS NOT ONLY APPARENT IN THAT
GOVERNMENTS ASSERT THAT ARMIES ARE NEEDED ABOVE ALL FOR EXTERNAL DEFENSE BUT THAT IS NOT TRUE
THEY ARE NEEDED PRINCIPALLY AGAINST THEIR SUBJECTS AND EVERY MAN UNDER UNIVERSAL MILITARY SERVICE BECOMES AN ACCOMPLICE IN ALL THE ACTS OF VIOLENCE OF THE GOVERNMENT AGAINST THE CITIZENS WITHOUT ANY CHOICE OF HIS OWN
AND FOR THE SAKE OF WHAT AM I MAKING THEM
I AM EXPECTED FOR THE SAKE OF THE STATE TO MAKE THESE SACRIFICES TO RENOUNCE EVERYTHING THAT CAN BE PRECIOUS TO MAN PEACE FAMILY SECURITY AND HUMAN DIGNITY
EXCEPT FOR THE STATE THEY SAY WE SHOULD BE EXPOSED TO THE ATTACKS OF EVIL DISPOSED PERSONS IN OUR OWN COUNTRY
WE KNOW NOW THAT THREATS AND PUNISHMENTS CANNOT DIMINISH THEIR NUMBER THAT THAT CAN ONLY BE DONE BY CHANGE OF ENVIRONMENT AND MORAL INFLUENCE
SO THAT THE JUSTIFICATION OF STATE VIOLENCE ON THE GROUND OF THE PROTECTION IT GIVES US FROM EVIL DISPOSED PERSONS EVEN IF IT HAD SOME FOUNDATION THREE OR FOUR CENTURIES AGO HAS NONE WHATEVER NOW
EXCEPT FOR THE STATE THEY TELL US WE SHOULD NOT HAVE ANY RELIGION EDUCATION CULTURE MEANS OF COMMUNICATION AND SO ON
WITHOUT THE STATE MEN WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO FORM THE SOCIAL INSTITUTIONS NEEDED FOR DOING ANY THING
THIS ARGUMENT TOO WAS WELL FOUNDED ONLY SOME CENTURIES AGO
THE GREAT EXTENSION OF MEANS OF COMMUNICATION AND INTERCHANGE OF IDEAS HAS MADE MEN COMPLETELY ABLE TO DISPENSE WITH STATE AID IN FORMING SOCIETIES ASSOCIATIONS CORPORATIONS AND CONGRESSES FOR SCIENTIFIC ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL OBJECTS
WITHOUT GOVERNMENTS NATIONS WOULD BE ENSLAVED BY THEIR NEIGHBORS
THE GOVERNMENT THEY TELL US WITH ITS ARMY IS NECESSARY TO DEFEND US FROM NEIGHBORING STATES WHO MIGHT ENSLAVE US
AND IF DEFENSE AGAINST BARBAROUS NATIONS IS MEANT ONE THOUSANDTH PART OF THE TROOPS NOW UNDER ARMS WOULD BE AMPLY SUFFICIENT FOR THAT PURPOSE
THE POWER OF THE STATE FAR FROM BEING A SECURITY AGAINST THE ATTACKS OF OUR NEIGHBORS EXPOSES US ON THE CONTRARY TO MUCH GREATER DANGER OF SUCH ATTACKS
EVEN LOOKING AT IT PRACTICALLY WEIGHING THAT IS TO SAY ALL THE BURDENS LAID ON HIM BY THE STATE NO MAN CAN FAIL TO SEE THAT FOR HIM PERSONALLY TO COMPLY WITH STATE DEMANDS AND SERVE IN THE ARMY WOULD IN THE MAJORITY OF CASES BE MORE DISADVANTAGEOUS THAN TO REFUSE TO DO SO
TO RESIST WOULD NEED INDEPENDENT THOUGHT AND EFFORT OF WHICH EVERY MAN IS NOT CAPABLE
SO MUCH FOR THE ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES OF BOTH LINES OF CONDUCT FOR A MAN OF THE WEALTHY CLASSES AN OPPRESSOR
FOR A MAN OF THE POOR WORKING CLASS THE ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES WILL BE THE SAME BUT WITH A GREAT INCREASE OF DISADVANTAGES
THE COMMONS ALSO VOTED THAT THE NEW CREATED PEERS OUGHT TO HAVE NO VOICE IN THIS TRIAL BECAUSE THE ACCUSATION BEING AGREED TO WHILE THEY WERE COMMONERS THEIR CONSENT TO IT WAS IMPLIED WITH THAT OF ALL THE COMMONS OF ENGLAND
IN THE GOVERNMENT OF IRELAND HIS ADMINISTRATION HAD BEEN EQUALLY PROMOTIVE OF HIS MASTER'S INTEREST AND THAT OF THE SUBJECTS COMMITTED TO HIS CARE
THE CASE OF LORD MOUNTNORRIS OF ALL THOSE WHICH WERE COLLECTED WITH SO MUCH INDUSTRY IS THE MOST FLAGRANT AND THE LEAST EXCUSABLE
THE COURT WHICH CONSISTED OF THE CHIEF OFFICERS OF THE ARMY FOUND THE CRIME TO BE CAPITAL AND CONDEMNED THAT NOBLEMAN TO LOSE HIS HEAD
WHERE THE TOKEN BY WHICH I SHOULD DISCOVER IT
IT IS NOW FULL TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY YEARS SINCE TREASONS WERE DEFINED AND SO LONG HAS IT BEEN SINCE ANY MAN WAS TOUCHED TO THIS EXTENT UPON THIS CRIME BEFORE MYSELF
LET US NOT TO OUR OWN DESTRUCTION AWAKE THOSE SLEEPING LIONS BY RATTLING UP A COMPANY OF OLD RECORDS WHICH HAVE LAIN FOR SO MANY AGES BY THE WALL FORGOTTEN AND NEGLECTED
HOWEVER THESE GENTLEMEN AT THE BAR SAY THEY SPEAK FOR THE COMMONWEALTH AND THEY BELIEVE SO YET UNDER FAVOR IT IS I WHO IN THIS PARTICULAR SPEAK FOR THE COMMONWEALTH
MY LORDS I HAVE NOW TROUBLED YOUR LORDSHIPS A GREAT DEAL LONGER THAN I SHOULD HAVE DONE
YOUNG VANE FALLING UPON THIS PAPER OF NOTES DEEMED THE MATTER OF THE UTMOST IMPORTANCE AND IMMEDIATELY COMMUNICATED IT TO PYM WHO NOW PRODUCED THE PAPER BEFORE THE HOUSE OF COMMONS
THE KING PROPOSES THIS DIFFICULTY BUT HOW CAN I UNDERTAKE OFFENSIVE WAR IF I HAVE NO MORE MONEY
YOUR MAJESTY HAVING TRIED THE AFFECTIONS OF YOUR PEOPLE YOU ARE ABSOLVED AND LOOSE FROM ALL RULES OF GOVERNMENT AND MAY DO WHAT POWER WILL ADMIT
THE GUILD OF SAINT ELIZABETH
IMMEDIATELY AFTER DINNER THAT EVENING LESLIE RAN UP TO HER ROOM TO MAKE PREPARATIONS FOR HER VISIT TO EAST HALL

WRAPPING A PRETTY BLUE SHAWL ROUND HER HEAD AND SHOULDERS SHE TURNED TO ANNIE
LESLIE WAS JUST CLOSING THE DOOR BEHIND HER WHEN ANNIE CALLED AFTER HER
I TOOK IT OUT SAID LESLIE TOOK IT OUT
HAVE THE GOODNESS TO FIND IT AND PUT IT BACK
BUT DON'T LOCK ME OUT PLEASE ANNIE
OH I WON'T LOCK YOU OUT SHE SAID BUT I MUST HAVE THE KEY
JANE HERIOT'S VOICE WAS HEARD IN THE PASSAGE

WHAT CAN THIS MEAN SHE SAID TO HERSELF
OH I WON'T PRESS YOU REPLIED JANE
OH I SHALL NEVER DO THAT REPLIED LESLIE

SHE WILL GET INTO AN AWFUL SCRAPE
I AM SURE SHE IS ILL SHE WORKS TOO HARD AND SHE BUT THERE I DON'T KNOW THAT I OUGHT TO SAY ANY MORE
I'LL WAIT FOR YOU HERE SAID LESLIE
DO COME ANNIE DO
SCARCELY LIKELY REPLIED LESLIE SHE TOLD ME SHE WAS DETERMINED NOT TO COME TO THE MEETING
BUT MARJORIE AND EILEEN HAD ALREADY DEPARTED AND LESLIE AND JANE FOUND THEMSELVES AMONG THE LAST STUDENTS TO ARRIVE AT THE GREAT EAST HALL
MISS LAUDERDALE WAS STANDING WITH THE OTHER TUTORS AND PRINCIPALS OF THE DIFFERENT HALLS ON A RAISED PLATFORM
THEN A ROLL CALL WAS GONE THROUGH BY ONE OF THE TUTORS THE ONLY ABSENTEE WAS ANNIE COLCHESTER
THE PHYSICAL PART OF YOUR TRAINING AND ALSO THE MENTAL PART ARE ABUNDANTLY SUPPLIED IN THIS GREAT HOUSE OF LEARNING SHE CONTINUED BUT THE SPIRITUAL PART IT SEEMS TO ME OUGHT NOW TO BE STRENGTHENED
HEAR HEAR AND ONCE AGAIN HEAR
SHE UTTERED HER STRANGE REMARK STANDING UP
MARJORIE AND EILEEN WERE CLOSE TO HER
I WILL TALK WITH YOU BELLE ACHESON PRESENTLY SHE SAID
THE NAMES OF PROPOSED MEMBERS ARE TO BE SUBMITTED TO ME BEFORE THIS DAY WEEK

GOD ANSWERS TO EACH OF YOU YOU ARE
THE WORLD SAYS NO I AM NOT BUT GOD SAYS YES YOU ARE
ALL MEN ARE YOUR BROTHERS
FOR ALL WHO SIN ALL WHO SUFFER YOU ARE TO A CERTAIN EXTENT RESPONSIBLE
AFTER THE ADDRESS THE GIRLS THEMSELVES WERE ENCOURAGED TO SPEAK AND A VERY ANIMATED DISCUSSION FOLLOWED
IT WAS PAST TEN O'CLOCK WHEN SHE LEFT THE HALL
JUST AS SHE WAS DOING SO MISS FRERE CAME UP
ANNIE COLCHESTER IS YOUR ROOMFELLOW IS SHE NOT SHE SAID
I SEE BY YOUR FACE MISS GILROY THAT YOU ARE DISTRESSED ABOUT SOMETHING ARE YOU KEEPING ANYTHING BACK
I AM AFRAID I AM REPLIED LESLIE DISTRESS NOW IN HER TONE
I MUST SEE HER MYSELF EARLY IN THE MORNING AND I AM QUITE SURE THAT NOTHING WILL SATISFY MISS LAUDERDALE EXCEPT A VERY AMPLE APOLOGY AND A FULL EXPLANATION OF THE REASON WHY SHE ABSENTED HERSELF
EXCUSES MAKE NO DIFFERENCE
THE GIRL WHO BREAKS THE RULES HAS TO BE PUNISHED
I WILL TELL HER
ANNIE COLCHESTER HAD BEGUN TO MAKE FRIENDS WITH LESLIE
LESLIE DETERMINED TO TRY FOR HONORS IN ENGLISH LANGUAGE AND LITERATURE
HER TASTES ALL LAY IN THIS DIRECTION HER IDEA BEING BY AND BY TO FOLLOW HER MOTHER'S PROFESSION OF JOURNALISM FOR WHICH SHE ALREADY SHOWED CONSIDERABLE APTITUDE
SHE HAD NO IDEA OF ALLOWING HERSELF TO BREAK DOWN
WHAT DO YOU MEAN REPLIED LESLIE
WHY YOU WILL BE PARTING FROM ME YOU KNOW
I WON'T BE THE CONSTANT WORRY AND PLAGUE OF YOUR LIFE
IT IS THIS IF BY ANY CHANCE YOU DON'T LEAVE SAINT WODE'S ANNIE I HOPE YOU WILL ALLOW ME TO BE YOUR ROOMFELLOW AGAIN NEXT TERM
SAID ANNIE A FLASH OF LIGHT COMING INTO HER EYES AND THEN LEAVING THEM
BUT SHE ADDED ABRUPTLY YOU SPEAK OF SOMETHING WHICH MUST NOT TAKE PLACE
I MUST PASS IN HONORS IF I DON'T I SHALL DIE
A FEW MOMENTS LATER THERE CAME A TAP AT THE DOOR
LESLIE OPENED THE DOOR
JANE HERIOT STOOD WITHOUT
THESE LETTERS HAVE JUST COME FOR YOU AND ANNIE COLCHESTER SHE SAID AND AS I WAS COMING UPSTAIRS I THOUGHT I WOULD LEAVE THEM WITH YOU
LESLIE THANKED HER AND EAGERLY GRASPED THE LITTLE PARCEL
HER EYES SHONE WITH PLEASURE AT THE ANTICIPATION OF THE DELIGHTFUL TIME SHE WOULD HAVE REVELING IN THE HOME NEWS THE OTHER LETTER WAS DIRECTED TO ANNIE COLCHESTER
HERE IS A LETTER FOR YOU ANNIE CRIED LESLIE
HER FACE GREW SUDDENLY WHITE AS DEATH WHAT IS IT DEAR
I HAVE BEEN STARVING OR RATHER I HAVE BEEN THIRSTING
WELL READ IT IN PEACE SAID LESLIE I WON'T DISTURB YOU
I AM TRULY GLAD IT HAS COME
LESLIE SEATED HERSELF WITH HER BACK TO HER COMPANION AND OPENED HER OWN LETTERS
DON'T NOTICE ME REPLIED ANNIE
I MUST GO INTO THE GROUNDS THE AIR IS STIFLING
BUT THEY ARE JUST SHUTTING UP
I SHALL GO I KNOW A WAY
JUST AFTER MIDNIGHT SHE ROSE WITH A SIGH TO PREPARE FOR BED
SHE LOOKED ROUND THE ROOM
NOW I REMEMBER SHE GOT A LETTER WHICH UPSET HER VERY MUCH AND WENT OUT
LESLIE WENT TO THE WINDOW AND FLUNG IT OPEN SHE PUT HER HEAD OUT AND TRIED TO PEER INTO THE DARKNESS BUT THE MOON HAD ALREADY SET AND SHE COULD NOT SEE MORE THAN A COUPLE OF YARDS IN FRONT OF HER
SHE IS A VERY QUEER ERRATIC CREATURE AND THAT LETTER THERE WAS BAD NEWS IN THAT LETTER
WHAT CAN SHE BE DOING OUT BY HERSELF
LESLIE LEFT THE ROOM BUT SHE HAD SCARCELY GONE A DOZEN PACES DOWN THE CORRIDOR BEFORE SHE MET ANNIE RETURNING
ANNIE'S EYES WERE VERY BRIGHT HER CHEEKS WERE NO LONGER PALE AND THERE WAS A BRILLIANT COLOR IN THEM
SHE DID NOT TAKE THE LEAST NOTICE OF LESLIE BUT GOING INTO THE ROOM SHUT THE DOOR
DON'T BEGIN SAID ANNIE
DON'T BEGIN WHAT DO YOU MEAN
I MEAN THAT I DON'T WANT YOU TO BEGIN TO ASK QUESTIONS
I WALKED UP AND DOWN AS FAST AS EVER I COULD OUTSIDE IN ORDER TO MAKE MYSELF SLEEPY
DON'T TALK TO ME LESLIE DON'T SAY A SINGLE WORD
I SHALL GO OFF TO SLEEP THAT IS ALL I CARE FOR
DON'T SAID ANNIE
NOW DRINK THIS AT ONCE SHE SAID IN A VOICE OF AUTHORITY IF YOU REALLY WISH TO SLEEP
ANNIE STARED VACANTLY AT THE COCOA THEN SHE UTTERED A LAUGH
DRINK THAT SHE SAID
DO YOU WANT TO KILL ME DON'T TALK ANY MORE
I AM SLEEPY I SHALL SLEEP
SHE GOT INTO BED AS SHE SPOKE AND WRAPPED THE CLOTHES TIGHTLY ROUND HER
CAN'T YOU MANAGE WITH A CANDLE JUST FOR ONCE
CERTAINLY SAID LESLIE
SHE TURNED OFF THE LIGHT AND LIT A CANDLE WHICH SHE PUT BEHIND HER SCREEN THEN PREPARED TO GET INTO BED
ANNIE'S MANNER WAS VERY MYSTERIOUS
ANNIE DID NOT MEAN TO CONFIDE IN ANYONE THAT NIGHT AND THE KINDEST THING WAS TO LEAVE HER ALONE
TIRED OUT LESLIE HERSELF DROPPED ASLEEP
ANNIE IS THAT YOU SHE CALLED OUT
THERE WAS NO REPLY BUT THE SOUND OF HURRYING STEPS CAME QUICKER AND QUICKER NOW AND THEN THEY WERE INTERRUPTED BY A GROAN
OH THIS WILL KILL ME MY HEART WILL BREAK THIS WILL KILL ME
